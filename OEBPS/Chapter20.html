      <p>Being
the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was not
an easy job. Neither was leading the Order of the Phoenix during the
first war against Voldemort. But both jobs entailed fewer headaches
than being the sole person aware of the entire Prophecy.</p>
      <p>
        <em>The
one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches ... Born to
those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies ...
And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power
the Dark Lord knows not ... And either must die at the hand of the
other for neither can live while the other survives ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>It
seemed rather simple at first; at least after the tragedy in Godric's
Hollow. The Potters were betrayed, but baby Harry struck down
Voldemort at the height of his powers. Their betrayer was soon locked
away at Azkaban and Wizarding society began its slow, halting ascent
from the dark times.</p>
      <p>Albus
Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore sat in his office, trying to enjoy
a lemon sherbet, trying to ignore his growing headache. "A riddle
wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma," a Muggle Prime Minister had
once said. It was a singularly apt description of one Harry James
Potter.</p>
      <p>The
boy was hiding something. That much was clear. He had the strongest
Occlumency the headmaster had ever encountered, yet he seemed to be
unaware of Legilimency. While 'naturally occluded' minds were not
unheard of, they were quite rare. On the other hand, his painful
reaction to repeated probing was in line with the handful of case
histories he'd researched since that meeting.</p>
      <p>Severus
was openly suspicious of the boy, but the potion master's
objectivity toward anyone named Potter was questionable. His
behaviour toward the boy and others had been deplorable on more than
one occasion.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless,
his theory regarding possession by Voldemort was technically
possible, even within a loose interpretation of the Prophecy.
However, the Sorting Hat had never been wrong before. After that
meeting, he'd even donned it himself - just to confirm that they
could converse, no matter how he engaged his own Occlumency.</p>
      <p>The
hat declared that there was nothing inside the boy's head but his
own mind. It had also sorted him into Gryffindor. While at least one
Gryffindor later became a betrayer, the boy had only been sorted a
year ago. Was it possible to deceive the Hat in any significant way?</p>
      <p>Academically,
the boy's performance was stellar. He and Miss Granger regularly
duelled for the top honours in most of their classes. Mr. Potter had
also lucked into becoming the youngest Quidditch player in over a
century. His knowledge and drive to succeed reminded him of another
young boy from so long ago.</p>
      <p>Tom
Riddle.</p>
      <p>Like
Riddle, Harry had surrounded himself with a coterie of other young
students. They seemed just as loyal as the group that later became
the first Death Eaters. That this group also included the Longbottom
boy, who was, coincidentally the other possible child of the
Prophecy, was also a concern. Miss Granger's intellect was
formidable, as Severus reported she was starting to deduce his use of
Legilimency from a startlingly small number of clues. Of course, the
way he described it was somewhat different in tone. Mister Weasley
started the year as an average student, but under the influence of
the others his academic performance had risen dramatically.</p>
      <p>Harry's
association with the Weasleys was also troubling. He'd known Arthur
since the Weasley patriarch was eleven years old, and the man had
been a staunch ally through the darkest days of the war. But after
coming into contact with young Harry, he'd been like a different
person.</p>
      <p>Harry's
obvious anger and distrust were understandable, if what he said
happened in his aunt's house was true. The possibilities were
disturbing either way. Of course he was dismayed to discover the boy
had been injured. But there was something else going on there as
well. He wasn't proud of the subtle hints he'd implanted in
Vernon Dursley's mind, but in the absence of gross provocation or
other meddling, the boy should have been safe. When that had not
proven sufficient, he was more than willing to take more drastic
measures, but Arthur's mind was already made up.</p>
      <p>He
didn't really understand why the Weasleys were so adamant about
taking care of Harry, but the boy had shown signs of being adept at
manipulating people. He'd never seen Severus Snape so enraged by a
first-year student before. Not to the point of jeopardizing his
tenure at Hogwarts. Minerva was also exceedingly sympathetic toward
the boy. Few Gryffindors had sufficient restraint and maturity to
make that kind of impression on their head of house.</p>
      <p>The
boy clearly impressed Amelia Bones, and that was no simple task.
After there was some sort of difficulty with their advocate, the boy
utilized a loop-hole to speak directly to the triumvirate on behalf
of the Weasleys application for guardianship. While he was reportedly
polite in his speech, he was also very firm in his convictions, and
presented a very strong case for his preferred guardians.</p>
      <p>The
headmaster had asked Amos to apply as a personal favour, though the
prestige of raising Harry Potter would no doubt further his career.
Due to his work for the Ministry, the Diggory's' home in Ottery
Saint Catchpole was extremely secure, and it would be much easier to
keep tabs on the boy's activities there.</p>
      <p>Of
course, it would have been an utter disaster if Lucius Malfoy had
gotten his hooks into the boy. It was doubtful that he'd have ever
returned to Hogwarts at that point. Nonetheless it was disturbing how
the boy had still managed to get his way, despite the concerns of
older and wiser adults.</p>
      <p>It
was a little suspicious how much the boy knew about things that were
not part of his class work, especially considering how he was raised.
On the other hand, young Harry could hardly be found without a book
in his hand, a habit he shared with Miss Granger. Minerva also
confided in him that Harry was a chronic insomniac, and spent much of
the night with book and quill. Of course, it wouldn't be too
unusual for someone who survived the killing curse to suffer long
term effects. The boy's fragmented memories of that awful night
seemed sufficient cause.</p>
      <p>That
was another troubling revelation. The boy claimed to have memories of
the night his parents were killed. It would be very unusual for
someone to remember something from that age, even worse for it to be
the sounds of their parents being murdered. At first he'd been
sceptical of the implications. While Sirius Black had never received
a formal trial, the evidence against him was overwhelming. The
Ministry was not interested in re-opening the case against Black, not
with all the bad press that could create. The alleged capture of
Peter Pettigrew was stirring things up though. It was an unlikely
coincidence that the fugitive Animagus just happened to be hiding out
at The Burrow, but Albus managed to talk to Auror Shacklebolt before
he'd been shuffled off to Italy.</p>
      <p>Kingsley
reported that Arthur recognized Peter from Black's description of
the boy's Animagus form and contacted the Auror for assistance in
capturing the rat. The Aurors on duty in Azkaban also confirmed the
facts of that conversation. It was all just a fortuitous coincidence,
it seems. Of course the Ministry was still dragging its feet in
admitting their terrible blunder. No doubt he would soon be hearing
from Harry or Arthur, if not both, if steps were not taken.</p>
      <p>Unlikely
coincidences would also describe the boy's habit of being in the
wrong place at the wrong time. The only thing more unlikely was
Harry's ability to get himself out of those situations. Though he'd
suffered a broken arm, few adult wizards could have dealt with a
fully-grown troll in so decisive a fashion. He was also in just the
right place at the right time to stop Quirrell from obtaining the
stone for his master. There were always explanations, but taken
together they started to become more and more strained. He almost
wished he hadn't returned James' cloak to the boy, but it really
wasn't his to keep. He also hoped that the belated gift might
soften the boy's anger towards his parents, as well as himself.
Besides, they boy may need its protection at some point, given the
enemies he'd already made.</p>
      <p>In
the end, there was no rational basis for his suspicions, really. But
it occurred to him that while the child marked by the Prophecy would
be inevitably opposed to Voldemort, it never guaranteed he would not
be dark himself. It was a troubling thought as he savoured the sour
aftertaste of his favourite confection.</p>
      <p>He
was jolted out of his thoughts as the gargoyle informed him a very
angry person was approaching. Albus Dumbledore checked the time. Yes,
the second year Gryffindor-Slytherin potions class had just ended.</p>
      <p>Harry
blessed his friends that week as they ran interference between him
and Colin Creevey. It was impossible to actively dislike the
excitable first year student, and Harry didn't want to directly
tell him off because he wasn't sure the little fellow wouldn't
have a breakdown. Not only would he feel like a cad, but he'd also
be playing into Malfoy's accusations as well. It was easier by far
to pretend to not hear the boy when he was apparently engrossed in a
conversation with one of his friends.</p>
      <p>Of
course, Colin wasn't the only person he was avoiding. Harry made a
big show of being in a hurry when Gilderoy Lockhart was nearby. The
only time the man could reliably corner Harry was during meal times,
and then only for a few minutes. The great fraud also seemed to be
less enthusiastic about conversing in front of witnesses - probably
because he'd need to keep track of more than one set of lies at
once.</p>
      <p>But
the one person Harry least wished to meet, he had no opportunity to
avoid. It was with a palpable sense of dread that the four of them
entered the potions laboratory for their first class. Professor
Snape's black eyes glittered in the dim light as he glared at them.</p>
      <p>Harry
tried to repeat his stratagem from last term. He weakened the
defences around his mind until it should appear acutely vulnerable.
Sure enough, as soon as Snape's lecture was over and they began
brewing a simple emulsifying solution, Harry felt twinges that
indicated a Legilimens was trying to penetrate his mind. Harry
blinked rapidly as the twinges became painful, but they soon stopped.
Neville, who was partnered with him for this exercise, began to frown
slightly. A moment later, Hermione looked up from her cauldron, her
face pale in the torchlight.</p>
      <p><em>Damn,</em>
Harry fumed; <em>he's going after them again. It's even worse now
that they've started learning Occlumency, because now they can
start to feel that bastard poking around in their minds.</em> Snape's
face grew thunderous and Hermione's jaw trembled. <em>He's digging
for something and she's fighting him tooth and nail. He must be
looking for how she figured it out. </em>She wasn't even making a
pretext of stirring her cauldron anymore. Ron looked up at her as a
furious tear tracked down her cheek.</p>
      <p>Harry
locked eyes with the potions teacher and lashed out with his own
Legilimency. He wasn't so much digging for information as just -
squeezing - as hard as he could. He didn't know what effect that
would have, but his mind's eye pictured crushing the man's skull
like an overripe fruit. Nothing happened as the man's defences
stiffened, but Hermione let out a tremulous sigh. Harry twitched as
he suddenly had the image of a diamond-hard wedge dig into the
boundaries of his own mind, seeking to cleave it in two. He countered
by imagining burning the Professor to death, an inch at a time,
starting with his toes.</p>
      <p>He
was jolted out of his reverie when a thick volume fell from the
Professor's desk. It struck the floor with a loud thud that echoed
in the dungeon, making most of the students jump. Snape's features
were locked in a rictus of fury.</p>
      <p>It
was going to be a long class.</p>
      <p>None
of them looked up as they turned in their flasks. Harry didn't even
turn around when he heard the sounds of glassware shattering on the
stone floor. As soon as they were out in the corridor, Harry
whispered in Hermione's ear and then quickly ducked into the
bathroom.</p>
      <p>Seeing
it was empty, Harry pulled his invisibility cloak out of this bag and
pulled it over his shoulders. He'd just settled it into place
before the door opened again and he had to side-step an older
Slytherin boy. Harry slipped out the door before it closed again.
Once in the corridor, Harry settled into a nook next to one of the
suits of armour and kept watch on the door to the potions lab.</p>
      <p>Sure
enough, less than five minutes later, Professor Snape came storming
out of the office, his face like a thundercloud about to let loose.
Harry shadowed the furious wizard all the way to the headmaster's
office. He needed some answers.</p>
      <p>"Gumdrops,"
the man snarled. He brushed past the gargoyle as it leapt aside.
Harry followed a bit more cautiously. Snape practically threw himself
up the escalator, while Harry waited at the foot of it. There was
just enough room for him to stand there as the passageway closed
again. On an idle evening while Harry was recovering from a skirmish,
Albus' portrait told him that the gargoyle magically reported
everything it saw to the current headmaster, but it wasn't as
perceptive as the headmaster himself. Harry was banking on the fact
that it wouldn't be able to see through the invisibility cloak like
its master could.</p>
      <p>Harry
knew the inner door wasn't soundproof, but Snape didn't even
bother closing it.</p>
      <p>"Ah
Severus, and what brings you here on this fine morning?" Harry
could almost imagine the headmaster's eyes twinkling as he said
that.</p>
      <p>"Potter,
Headmaster, what else?"</p>
      <p>"And
what is he up to now?"</p>
      <p>"He
and that insufferable know it all Granger have somehow pieced
together that we have been using Legilimency. He's been teaching
his verminous little friends how to block me out!"</p>
      <p>"Severus,
I will remind you that they are still students, and should be
respected as such."</p>
      <p>"I
will show them as much respect as they have shown me."</p>
      <p>Harry
heard a sigh. "How did they figure it out?"</p>
      <p>"Granger
isn't quite as good as she thinks she is. I managed to pull that
information out of her, along with her delusions of adequacy and
disturbingly adolescent infatuations. Your words were actually the
give-away, Albus."</p>
      <p>"Oh?"</p>
      <p>"You
should have expelled Potter when you found him in the restricted
section, rather than warning him. Their nightly forays were not known
to anyone else, so she surmised that the information had been
extracted from her mind."</p>
      <p>"Interesting.
She is rather sharp, isn't she?"</p>
      <p>"I
suppose. For being a Mudblood with no sense of respect, I suppose
there should be some consolation."</p>
      <p>"Severus,
I will not hear that word used in my presence."</p>
      <p>"Fine.
For an insufferable know it all with no respect for her betters."</p>
      <p>Another
sigh. "I have also discovered what young Mr. Potter was seeking in
the Restricted Section. He was looking for information on the
Fidelius Charm. He remembered some of James and Lily's last words,
when they mentioned that spell."</p>
      <p>Harry
could almost hear Snape's head snap around as this information
pierced his tantrum. "Why is that so important?" he asked in a
quiet voice.</p>
      <p>There
was a long pause. "Peter Pettigrew was captured by the Ministry a
week ago. There are indications that he was the secret keeper, rather
than Black."</p>
      <p>Harry
could have sworn he felt the air around him grow cold.</p>
      <p>"It
doesn't matter. Black still massacred a dozen Muggles. He'll die
in Azkaban."</p>
      <p>"Severus,
Peter's capture means the investigation will be reopened."</p>
      <p>"Perhaps,
I doubt that will happen though."</p>
      <p>"And
why is that?"</p>
      <p>"Some
remarks Lucius made a few days ago are making more sense now. He
mentioned in passing that an important prisoner was being held under
wraps until 'the point was moot', whatever that means. I have no
doubt that there are many in the Ministry who would prefer that this
matter never see the light of day."</p>
      <p>"Is
there a reason you didn't tell me about this?"</p>
      <p>"Other
than the fact that I only made the connection with what you just told
me regarding Pettigrew? Besides, Azkaban is no more than Black
deserves."</p>
      <p>"Severus,
if he is innocent-"</p>
      <p>"He
tried to kill me!"</p>
      <p>"And
James saved you."</p>
      <p>The
silence was palpable.</p>
      <p>"Why
was Lucius Malfoy so concerned about this, anyway?"</p>
      <p>"I
imagine it has to do with his wife being the last of the Blacks,
discounting Sirius and Bellatrix who are in Azkaban. With Sirius
dead, Narcissa would receive half the Black fortune. When Bellatrix
dies, she'll receive the other half."</p>
      <p>"It
would be better for that money not to end up under Lucius' control.
His wealth has purchased him half the Ministry as it is." </p>
      <p>"Do
not expect me to spare any efforts toward freeing Black. Besides, if
it looked like a trial was inevitable, I imagine he'll be
accidentally kissed by a dementor. Such a tragedy that would be."</p>
      <p>Harry's
blood went cold. He ruthlessly suppressed his emotions before another
accidental magic outburst gave his presence away.</p>
      <p>"I
am... disappointed in you, Severus. Back to the matter at hand, why
are you here?"</p>
      <p>"Why
am I - Headmaster, we cannot allow these impudent delinquents to get
away with this!"</p>
      <p>A
third sigh. "What do you propose we do?"</p>
      <p>"Expell
them all!" Harry could almost imagine Snape was frothing at the
mouth by now. He had no idea how infuriating the headmaster's
patience could be when used against someone that far out of control.</p>
      <p>"And
how would we explain this action? The use of Legilimency on students
has never been officially sanctioned, and I doubt it ever will be.
Many would consider it a frightful breach of privacy, no matter how
well-intentioned. I doubt you would be accorded that much
benevolence, as your reputation does you no good there."</p>
      <p>"Fine
then. How do you propose we stop them?"</p>
      <p>"Severus,
we can't prohibit them from learning a branch of magic that has no
use aside from preventing unwanted, not to mention unwarranted,
intrusions."</p>
      <p>"Headmaster!
They. Are. Up. To. Something!"</p>
      <p>"I
have no doubt that they are, or at least that young Harry was some
hidden agenda. But what has he actually done? He killed a troll that
poor Quirinius was compelled to let into the school... saving the
life of one or more of his fellow students. He also stopped Voldemort
from procuring the stone and regaining his powers. Thus far, I
believe he had earned some small degree of trust."</p>
      <p>"He's
been training those friends of his in Muggle fighting skills. Are you
content to let a student form his own gang within the school?"</p>
      <p>"Of
course not. But then again, when have they behaved aggressively
without provocation? Severus, I understand you've had a difficult
time trying to bring around some of the students in your house. But
I'm starting to wonder if I've given you too much leeway with
respect to their behaviour."</p>
      <p>"Headmaster,
I'm not sure I understand what you mean."</p>
      <p>"I
mean that every time I... investigate... a complaint about aggressive
behaviour by Harry or one of his friends, I invariably find a member
of <em>your</em> house was the instigator. One might think the whole
thing was organized with the express purpose of having one or more
students removed from Hogwarts."</p>
      <p>If
anything, the air had become even colder.</p>
      <p>"I
will see if there is any substance to the suspicions, headmaster, and
act accordingly. Good day."</p>
      <p>With
that, the upper door opened and the gargoyle moved aside just in time
for Harry to exit the entryway ahead of Professor Snape. Harry didn't
relish getting caught by the man after listening to the less than
subtle dressing down he'd just received.</p>
      <p>Harry
had a lot to think about as he rejoined his friends. He actually felt
more optimistic about Dumbledore than he had in a while. He wasn't
willing to just let Snape run roughshod over them. It wasn't
everything Harry could hope for, but it was a start.</p>
      <p>On
the other hand, Sirius' situation was just as bad as he thought, if
not worse. The presence of a new warden at Azkaban was particularly
ominous, if that threat about the kiss was more than just a pleasant
fantasy for Snape. Draco's comments in the courtyard also took on a
whole new meaning. <em>He meant I would be envious of his father's
ability to get out of Azkaban because Sirius was stuck there. Maybe
it's time to demonstrate that there's more than one kind of coin
to spend.</em></p>
      <p>The
look on Harry's face when he joined his friends for lunch left them
more than willing to wait until they could talk privately. Luna and
Ginny told a very funny story from their last charms class. Colin
tried to enchant one of his many pictures of Harry to make it talk.
Unfortunately, the picture he'd taken seemed to be in a rather
cross mood, because its language was exceedingly vulgar. Colin
couldn't make out all the words said by the tiny, high-pitched
voice coming from the snapshot, but Professor Flitwick could and he
was less than impressed.</p>
      <p>Colin
had also started sitting with Ginny and Luna in their classes. While
he was obviously sucking up, Harry was also secretly glad. He had a
quiet paranoia that someone would attack the girls when they were
separated from the rest of the group. If that ever happened, an extra
friendly wand in the vicinity couldn't hurt.</p>
      <p>Of
course Harry knew that was just his memory speaking. It was harder to
blot out the Hogwarts Massacre when he was at the proverbial scene of
the crime. It was particularly hard to suppress when Ginny was
around. The way she looked at him sometimes, he knew he was letting
too much of his anxiety show. How can he tell her he wants to carry
her off and so he can keep her safe? She'd either laugh or kick him
where it hurt for thinking she was helpless.</p>
      <p>They
didn't have any classes after lunch, so they all walked down to the
lake to enjoy the warmer weather before it was gone. Harry wanted to
tell them what he'd overheard, but he couldn't share while their
minds were still open. Just by existing, Snape was driving a wedge
between him and his friends.</p>
      <p>Still,
he could do this subtly. "You know," he began, "something
Malfoy said keeps sticking in my mind."</p>
      <p>"Bah,
I'd see Madam Pomfrey about that, mate!" Ron quipped.</p>
      <p>"Shut
it, you," Harry replied with a grin. "He said something about me
envying being able to buy someone out of Azkaban. I think he knows
something about Sirius."</p>
      <p>"What
motive would they have for being involved in a cover-up?" Hermione
asked. "Who stands to gain from Sirius being imprisoned?"</p>
      <p>"There
are some people in the Ministry that will be embarrassed if this gets
out," Neville said. "Some people may lose office over it."</p>
      <p>"None
of the Malfoys hold office though," Harry said, frowning.</p>
      <p>"Maybe
he doesn't want to have to buy new politicians?" Ron asked.</p>
      <p>They
speculated a bit longer, but no one made the connection that
Narcissa's maiden name was Black. Harry sighed. <em> Maybe it didn't
matter if they know. I'll just give them warning about what I'm
going to do. </em>"I think I better go ahead and send that letter to
Rita Skeeter. It's been too long and I'm getting really
suspicious."</p>
      <p>"If
you want, I can go over the rough draft with you," Hermione
offered.</p>
      <p>"I'd
appreciate it," Harry said with a grin. She always came out ahead
on essay assignments.</p>
      <p>Harry
felt a little smug that he'd gone to bed early Friday night, so
Oliver's extremely early morning summons didn't leave him dead on
his feet. In fact, the Gryffindor captain was surprised when he
stepped into their dormitory and found Harry, Ron, and Neville
getting ready for their morning run. "Oh, er, right. You're
already up? We have practice now."</p>
      <p>Harry
shrugged. "Okay Ron, you and Neville take everyone on their run.
We'll probably still be at the pitch when you're done. Could one
of you work one-on-one with Luna? She's got the most to make up."</p>
      <p>"I'll
take care of it," Neville said. "I need to work on the basics
anyway."</p>
      <p>"Right,"
Harry said, pulling his Quidditch robes and Nimbus 2000 out of his
trunk.</p>
      <p>"You've
been working out?" Wood asked as they headed down the stairs.</p>
      <p>"A
run in the morning and some martial arts," Harry replied.</p>
      <p>Oliver
nodded approvingly. "I can tell. You've filled out a bit."</p>
      <p>Harry
shrugged as they brushed past Colin. "The twins joined us most of
the time."</p>
      <p>"Good!
Most of the teams will be taking aim at us now," the team captain
grinned.</p>
      <p>When
they reached the changing rooms, everyone else was asleep on their
feet. Oliver began describing some new plays he'd put together over
the summer. Unfortunately, even with a clear head, Oliver's game
plans made almost no sense to Harry.</p>
      <p>When
Oliver lost his temper at the groggy twins, his spiel about the
previous season was more upbeat, but just as impassioned. "Yes, we
got the cup last year. So now, everyone is looking to take us out of
the running at every opportunity. The other teams will bring their
best games when they play us! We can't let our guard down, even for
a moment!"</p>
      <p>"Constant
Vigilance!" Harry interjected. He really couldn't help it.</p>
      <p>"That's
right!" Oliver shouted. "We can't let up on them, even for an
instant. I want every game to be a blow-out. Any match we win by less
than one hundred and fifty points we should consider a personal
defeat!" He looked at his chasers. "Are you girls with me?"</p>
      <p>Katie,
Alicia, and Angelina blinked and nodded.</p>
      <p>"Are
you with me?" Oliver repeated.</p>
      <p>The
girls looked resignedly at each other. "Yes we are!" they shouted
in reply.</p>
      <p>"I
want their Seekers and Chasers afraid to get near anything round,"
Oliver snarled, turning toward the twins. "I want them terrified of
flying by the time you're done with them. Are you with me?" </p>
      <p>"We'll
make them need to clean their brooms after the match," one of them
replied, starting to wake up. He nudged his brother.</p>
      <p>"And
we'll make you lot forget they even have Bludgers. Right?"</p>
      <p>Oliver
looked pleased for just an instant. Then he led them out to the
pitch.</p>
      <p>Harry
smiled when he saw his friends sitting together on the stands. They
were still adamant about him not walking around by himself if they
could help it, especially at scheduled times like Quidditch
practices.</p>
      <p>They
were just getting started when the Slytherin team marched out onto
the pitch. Harry followed Wood down to the grass, and noticed his
friends already getting up from the stands.</p>
      <p>"Flint!"
Wood bellowed. "This is our practice time! We got up especially for
this, so you can clear off now!"</p>
      <p>Marcus
Flint, who bore a more than passing resemblance to the troll they
killed last year, had a nasty grin. "Plenty of room for all of us,
Wood."</p>
      <p>Harry
knew they'd love to hold a joint practice. Not only would it let
them see any new plays Oliver put together, but it also gave them the
opportunity to inflict some 'accidental' injuries.</p>
      <p>"I
booked the field!" Oliver insisted. "I booked it."</p>
      <p>Harry
suppressed a grin. While the Slytherins were all leering at the
chasers, who'd just landed, Ron had directed his friends to take up
a flanking position on the Slytherin team. No one had wands out yet,
but if anything started they'd be in a position to hit the green
robes from the side, with no worries about friendly fire. <em>Evidently
Ron did read that book on war games and small unit tactics, </em>Harry
mused, <em>he put up such a fuss about extra reading that I began to
wonder if he would.</em></p>
      <p>Flint
smirked at Wood. "I've got a note right here..." and he read
off the note from Snape usurping their field reservation because they
needed to train their new seeker... Draco Malfoy,</p>
      <p>When
the Slytherin team unveiled their Nimbus Two Thousand and One brooms
- a gift from Lucius, Harry decided to take this whole encounter in
a different direction. He fell to his knees, laughing.</p>
      <p>Wood
looked alarmed, and Harry noticed Fred and George moving behind him.
Harry pointed a shaking finger at Draco, which the blond boy slapped
away as his face purpled.</p>
      <p>"Oh
bloody hell Flint, you got screwed. You actually agreed to take
Malfoy as your Seeker? Bwahahaha!"</p>
      <p>"What
the hell is wrong with your Seeker, Wood?" Flint snarled, though
his eyes began to look a little uneasy.</p>
      <p>"Sorry,"
Harry chuckled before snorting as he slowly rose to his feet. "I
guess you didn't know. Draco here is dead useless on a broom. He's
been flying for years, according to him, and the first time I mount a
broom I fly rings around him. I don't think a free set of brooms is
worth forfeiting the next six Quidditch Cups."</p>
      <p>Draco's
team-mates began to eye him warily. "That filthy half-blood is
lying!" the boy snarled. He tried to kick Harry, but only managed
to ram his shin into the Gryffindor's heel when he blocked.</p>
      <p>As
Draco hobbled backward Harry produced a nasty grin. "Tell you what;
I'll put my money where my mouth is. If Draco EVER beats me to the
Snitch in a real match, I'll buy you another set of brooms myself."</p>
      <p>"Pretty
big talk coming from such a tiny little beggar," Flint said,
smirking at Wood.</p>
      <p>"The
best players don't ride the broom like a walrus perched on a
toothpick," Oliver observed coolly.</p>
      <p>"Why
don't we head down to the lake," Harry said. "The air here
smells a bit... off."</p>
      <p>With
a little work, they were able to transfigure some sticks into
regulation-sized goals and continued their practice by the lake.
Harry's friends sat under a tree and watched them fly... and
coincidentally kept an eye out for anyone a little too interested in
what the team was doing.</p>
      <p>As
they walked back to the changing rooms, Oliver kept glancing at
Harry. "Do they always follow you around like that?" he asked.</p>
      <p>Harry
nodded. "Ever since someone jinxed my broom at my first match."</p>
      <p>"Someone
what?" Wood shouted.</p>
      <p>Harry just raised his eyebrows. "It's
not a big deal. I just kept dispelling it until they gave up."</p>
      <p>"But
what if the Snitch appeared while you were busy? That's cheating!"</p>
      <p>Harry
laughed. "Don't ever change Oliver. Anyway, Malfoy and his little
buddies would love to catch any of us alone, so we're pretty
careful about that. Especially practices, because everyone knows
where I am."</p>
      <p>Oliver
nodded, frowning.</p>
      <p>"You
ever think about setting up a reserve team?" Harry asked.</p>
      <p>"We've
tried it before, but there aren't a lot of people that are willing
to practice if there isn't a guarantee they'll get to play."</p>
      <p>"I
see. But it's a good way to break in new players, isn't it?"</p>
      <p>"Aye,
it is. You have some people in mind?"</p>
      <p>"Well,
Ron is a decent Keeper, and we discovered Ginny is-"</p>
      <p>"Oy!"
a voice shouted from behind them. "George and I do NOT need to be
reminded of that."</p>
      <p>"Indeed
we do not, brother of mine. Being schooled by your wee little sister
at Quidditch is NOT a happy memory."</p>
      <p>"Is
she really that good?" Oliver asked doubtfully.</p>
      <p>Gred
and Forge sped up until they were flanking them. "Seriously?"
George asked. "If our lasses weren't a well-oiled scoring
machine, I think she could easily start at Chaser." </p>
      <p>Oliver
looked thoughtful. "You know, it wouldn't hurt to have someone on
hand, in case of an injury."</p>
      <p>"Same
goes for your spot, oh fearless leader," Fred quipped.</p>
      <p>"Spot
on!" George agreed, "Ickle Ronnikins isn't so ickle anymore. He
keeps growing like he is he'll be able to block two hoops at the
same time."</p>
      <p>"Let
me talk to Professor McGonagall about it," Oliver said.</p>
      <p>After
they cleaned up, Harry and the rest paid a visit to Hagrid. The
groundskeeper didn't think much of Draco buying his way onto the
Slytherin team with a new set of brooms, and he echoed Harry's low
opinion of Lockhart. Neville was impressed with Hagrid's pumpkin
patch and they compared notes on compost mixtures. Luna just sat and
silently stared at Hagrid almost the entire time, much to Ginny's
amusement.</p>
      <p>"Well,
ye are a quie' one, aren' ye?" Hagrid asked her, chuckling.</p>
      <p>"I'm
sorry, but I'd never met a half-giant before," she replied. "You
don't really live up to the reputation though, you are much too
nice."</p>
      <p>Harry
was fairly sure he could have dropped a pin and made everyone jump.</p>
      <p>"I,
er, I, uh," was all Hagrid could say.</p>
      <p>"I'm
sure she didn't mean it," Hermione said quickly.</p>
      <p>"You
don't think he's nice?" Luna asked her, "He seems very nice
to me."</p>
      <p>Hagrid's
reaction left no room to doubt Luna's assessment. "I think
half-giant means just about as much as being a half-blood," Harry
said. "It's just a label, nothing more."</p>
      <p>"Well,
yeah," Ron agreed. "But Harry, people, well... Giants have a bit
of a reputation, you know."</p>
      <p>"Some
varieties of Muggles think wizards and witches are inherently evil,
too," Harry countered</p>
      <p>"Harry,
I think what Ron means is that people would react very badly if they
found out Hagrid wasn't just a very large man. Even though we know
better."</p>
      <p>Harry
shrugged. "I don't want to make trouble for you, Hagrid, but it
really doesn't matter what people call you. You're still the same
person to me."</p>
      <p>The
rest of them all agreed and Hagrid got a bit sniffely after that. He
blew his nose on an oversized handkerchief, loosening all their teeth
with the racket. They agreed to keep quiet about it; though Harry
knew there might be problems later.</p>
      <p>As
they walked back to the castle, Hermione stunned them all by asking a
question about Quidditch. "Is having an older broom really a
handicap?"</p>
      <p>"Well,"
Ron answered immediately, "it depends on how old. Most of the team
has Cleansweep fives, and against a late-model Nimbus, there's a
definite disadvantage, both in speed and manoeuvrability. The Nimbus
also has superior acceleration, which is paramount for Seekers and
Chasers."</p>
      <p>Everyone
stared at Ron for a moment. He blinked. "What?" the red-head
finally asked.</p>
      <p>"Professor
Quidditch," Hermione said, patting his arm fondly. "That was
exactly what I needed to know. I think the Gryffindor team needs new
brooms, don't you?" she asked, looking at Harry.</p>
      <p>Harry
frowned. "I don't know how expensive that would be, but I don't
think Professor McGonagall would let me-"</p>
      <p>"I
don't think it's a question of paying," Hermione said with a
smile. "Let me talk to her and see if she'll agree."</p>
      <p>"All
right," Harry replied. He knew that when Hermione came up with a
scheme, she usually preferred to not unveil it until she'd worked
out all the bugs. It was usually more impressive that way, and she
wasn't that far away from the shy ten year old that didn't have
any friends.</p>
      <p>Monday
morning, Harry was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the owl post. He
happily paid for his reserved copy of the Daily Prophet. The story
was exactly where he expected it to be, on the front page.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Boy Who Lived Speaks!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>-By Rita Skeeter</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Harry Potter is very
angry young man. It isn't because his parents were lost on one
horrible Halloween night. It's because the man who betrayed them to
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named went free. And an innocent man was condemned
without a trial. It's enough to make the boy who saved us from the
Dark Lord wonder why he bothered...</em>
      </p>
      <p>Harry
whistled as he read. Rita stuck to the plan, for the most part, but
she did make a few small changes. She had a natural gift for
invective and wasn't afraid to use it. He imagined the Ministry
bore some resemblance to a kicked over ant hill right now.</p>
      <p>His
agreement with the reporter was fairly straightforward. Harry had
access to information that few people did, and she made her living
spreading information. He would provide her with exclusives from time
to time that he would be willing to swear were factual. If a story
came up that involved him, Harry promised to give her the first
interview. In return, she would present the information in the manner
he wished, and didn't go digging for more. Since Harry wasn't
speaking to any other members of the fourth estate, it wasn't a bad
deal for her. He also promised not to tell anyone about her Animagus
form - though he also refused to tell her how he knew.</p>
      <p>Mr.
Weasley knew this was coming, so he would be ready if there was an
inquiry at work. Fortunately, the capture of Pettigrew had nothing to
do with his official duties, so it would be hard to censure him for
Harry's words. And if someone did come down on him, Rita might have
a follow-up story.</p>
      <p>While
his legal guardian enjoyed his work in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts
office, it wouldn't break Harry's heart if the man found other
employment. It was, after all, in the discharge of his duties that he
was stabbed and fatally poisoned by Lucius Malfoy. There were two
long-term courses of action open to Harry to prevent this. The first
involved Arthur no longer working for the Ministry. The second
involved him advancing to the point where he was no longer on the
front lines.</p>
      <p>While
Harry was more than happy to help the man in any way possible, he was
less than sanguine about sabotaging his career. The only thing
forestalling the wrath of Harry's conscience was the fact that
Arthur said he didn't care about his career as long as Sirius'
freedom was on the line. It amazed Harry that some people considered
Arthur Weasley 'weak' or 'hen-pecked'.</p>
      <p>Harry
passed around the article as soon as he was done. Ron let out a low
whistle when he finished. "Typical Ministry incompetence carried to
an unconscionable degree? Why doesn't she tell us how she really
feels?"</p>
      <p>"She
does not sound like someone I'd like to be on the bad side of,"
Hermione agreed.</p>
      <p><em>You
don't know the half of it,</em> Harry thought with a smirk.</p>
      <p>Their
next class, Defence against the Dark Arts, did not really improve
under Lockhart's stewardship. As sort of a nasty sport, they had
taken to studiously reading every chapter before it was to be
covered. Once they were in class, they began to ask rather pointed
questions, pressing Professor Lockhart for more details on how he
defeated the assorted menaces.</p>
      <p>Hermione,
who might still have been holding some faint hope that he wasn't a
complete fraud, took to this with a will. Ironically, she was also
the most adept at picking apart his explanations. They were never
directly confrontational, but by the end of class Lockhart was
usually sweating. In a twisted way, they did learn a few things about
dealing with Dark creatures - after all, the accounts in his books
<em>were</em> drawn from the memories of the people who actually did
the deeds. When they asked a question that obviously hadn't been
asked during his interviews, Lockhart's fabrications were painfully
obvious. They got a little education, along with torturing the ponce,
so their time wasn't completely wasted. </p>
      <p>When
Lockhart asked Harry to stay after class though, it wasn't to talk
about their questions.</p>
      <p>"Harry,
Harry, Harry... I warned you that you'd need my expert guidance."</p>
      <p>"I'm
not sure I understand what you're talking about, sir."</p>
      <p>"I
read the article in today's Prophet. Very dramatic, and it got you
on the front page, but dabbling in politics... it can't be good for
your career in the long term."</p>
      <p>"My
career, sir?" Harry decided to hold himself as stiff and formal as
possible. It wouldn't do to loose control of his temper and tell
this strutting peacock what he really thought.</p>
      <p>"As
a celebrity. I'm glad to see you are finally realizing the truth of
my words but this... it doesn't do to make too many enemies, Harry.
Especially this early in the game. Politicians have long memories and
you can sacrifice too many opportunities. Now, I've taken the
liberty of crafting a masterful retraction for you." With that he
picked up a parchment covered with lavender ink. "Just sign this
and I'll send it off to my press agent to distribute and you can
put this nasty blunder behind you. He's agreed to take care of
this, free of charge, if you'll consent to have lunch with us this
weekend. He's found this wonderful little café that's
opened near-"</p>
      <p>Having
already bit back his first three responses, Harry interrupted, "I'm
sorry, sir, but I had to give Ms. Skeeter a signed affidavit
regarding the facts before she would print the article. I don't
think a retraction would hold much water."</p>
      <p>Lockhart
frowned. "You poor boy! I had no idea you were such a babe in the
woods. You should never, ever, agree to something like that," he
said, wagging his finger. "It's almost impossible to say you were
misquoted if you do that!"</p>
      <p>"That
doesn't really matter to me, sir. I only gave her that information
because I want my Godfather released."</p>
      <p>"A
man you've only met one time?"</p>
      <p>"Because
he was imprisoned for something he didn't do!" Harry snapped, his
temper fraying.</p>
      <p>Lockhart
sighed. "Harry, this obsession with right and wrong is definitely
going to hurt your career."</p>
      <p>"Thank
you for your concern, professor. I need to leave or I'm going to be
late for my next class."</p>
      <p>Lockhart
waved him off, but he was still late for transfiguration. McGonagall
scowled and told him to see her after class.</p>
      <p>Harry
was so infuriated that first pebble he transfigured into a rubber
ball ended up covered with wicked looking spikes and
suspicious-looking rusty brown stains. Hermione raised her eyebrows
at him but didn't say anything.</p>
      <p>She
did, however, lag behind after class when Harry marched up to
Professor McGonagall's desk.</p>
      <p>"I'm
sorry I was late, professor, but Professor Lockhart kept me after his
class." Harry was less than successful in keeping the frustration
out of his voice.</p>
      <p>McGonagall
raised an eyebrow at him. "I was not aware you were having
difficulties in Defence against the Dark Arts, Mr. Potter."</p>
      <p>"I'm
not, Ma'am. No more than anyone else. He wanted to talk to me about
the article in the Prophet, and how I need to manage my career as a
celebrity."</p>
      <p>Hermione
muffled a sigh, but McGonagall's lips just got the tiniest but
thinner. "I see. Well, it is somewhat in connection with that
status that I wanted to see you today. Ms. Granger has informed me of
the recent... donation... made to the Slytherin house team. She has
an idea for how to address that, but she wanted my approval before
speaking to anyone on the team. While I appreciate her discretion, I
felt that you should be the next to hear this idea. Ms. Granger?"</p>
      <p>Hermione
bit her lip. "Well Harry, as you know, Muggle athletes will
sometimes get endorsement contracts with companies that manufacture
sporting goods or clothing. I was thinking perhaps we could write to
Nimbus and see if they'd be willing to supply last year's
Quidditch champions with new brooms. In exchange, they could take
pictures of the team in their robes, holding the cup, riding on their
brooms... The advertising would more than make back their costs, I'd
think." She hesitated. "Especially with that whole Boy Who Lived
thing."</p>
      <p>Harry
blinked. "That's utterly brilliant... Oliver's going to kiss
you when he hears this!"</p>
      <p>Hermione
turned bright red.</p>
      <p>Harry
chuckled, thinking of Draco's reaction. He'd always claimed Harry
was a show-off, now to make him suffer for it... "One thing,"
Harry said as he thought about Hermione's last words, "Make sure
they only use pictures of all of us together. I don't mind being in
it, but I want this to be about the team, not me. It took all of us
to win that cup, and Oliver wants to play professionally after he
graduates."</p>
      <p>Hermione
nodded eagerly. "I'll start writing the letter today."</p>
      <p>"I'll
speak to the Headmaster about using the Quidditch Cup in the
photographs," McGonagall said, "but I don't think that will be
a problem. This is an ingenious solution to a vexing inequity, Ms.
Granger - ten points to Gryffindor."</p>
      <p>Hermione
was practically skipping as they left the classroom.</p>
      <p>When
she explained the plan to the rest of them at lunch, Ron embarrassed
himself by yelling "That's BRILLIANT!" at the top of his lungs.
The normal meal-time chatter ground to a halt as everyone in the
Great Hall stared at the Gryffindor table. Harry suppressed a laugh
as Ron ducked his head down. Hermione's face was just as scarlet,
but for a different reason.</p>
      <p>That
night, Harry was feeling particularly confident, so he decided to
work on something he'd been putting off. After everyone was asleep,
he opened up his trunk and dug out the Diary he'd concealed in the
bottom.</p>
      <p>Settling
back down on his bed, Harry pulled out his quill and began writing.</p>
      <p>"Dear
Diary, my name is Harry Potter."</p>
      <p>The
ink absorbed into the page and reappeared in a new configuration:
"Hello Harry, my name is Tom."</p>
      <p>Harry
felt a chill race down his spine. Sitting there in his hands was a
piece of Voldemort's soul, one of the anchors that let him live on
after the killing curse rebounded in his face.</p>
      <p>"Hello
Tom, I've never seen a diary that wrote back to me before. How were
you made?"</p>
      <p>"I
don't remember Harry. It must be magic though. Are you a wizard?"</p>
      <p>And
so it went for the better part of an hour. The diary deflected any
questions about itself or how it was made, while Harry avoided giving
it any details. Harry finally gave it up as a bad job. He bade it
good night and closed the cover, frowning.</p>
      <p><em>This
thing is both self-aware and cagey,</em> he mused. <em>I was hoping I
could get some information out of it regarding how it was created and
how Tom planned to create the other Horcruxes. I don't know all the
details, let alone how to destroy the ring without losing a hand, but
I don't think I'll be getting much help here. </em></p>
      <p>With
that, he threw on a dressing gown and quietly left the dormitory. The
common room was deserted, the fireplace banked to ward off the chill
from the stone walls.</p>
      <p>Making
sure the couches and squashy chairs were unoccupied, Harry made his
way to the fire. If the destruction of the diary made any
disturbance, hopefully it would be chalked up to normal Hogwarts
weirdness or blamed on Peeves. Harry leaned forward and tossed the
diary onto the fireplace, then jumped back.</p>
      <p>Some
sparks shot up as embers were knocked loose from the burning log.
Flames licked around the cover, but the faded leather didn't
darken. Harry stared in disbelief for several minutes before he
picked up the fireplace poker. He jammed the diary down into the hot
coals but it still refused the catch. He ground the poker into the
front cover, but it remained unmarred.</p>
      <p>Finally,
Harry gave up and hooked the spine of the book and pulled it out of
the fire. He left it in front of the hearth to cool as he hung the
poker back up. A few minutes later the still-warm diary was back in
the bottom of his locked trunk and Harry was staring up at the canopy
over his bed.</p>
      <p>Sleep
did not come easily that night.</p>
      <p>Over
the next few days, the Daily Prophet carried several stories related
to the imprisonment of Sirius Black. The first was an outright denial
that the whole mess was being covered up. According to 'sources
within the Department of Magical Law Enforcement', an unregistered
Animagus had indeed been captured. However, the wizard was reported
to be unidentified and in a highly disturbed mental state. He
reportedly would not stay in his human form unless stunned, which
complicated the identification process.</p>
      <p>After
that, the inevitable counter-attacks on Harry began. A 'senior
ministry official' speculated to another reporter (not Rita, of
course - she knew better than to annoy the goose that produced such
golden eggs) that Harry was delusional, and seeking to free Black out
of some misplaced sense of guilt over his parents' deaths. That
remark led to Harry gouging a chip out of his breakfast plate.</p>
      <p>By
the end of the week, other publications had taken up the torch.
Friday morning, Luna received a thick rolled-up newspaper from an
owl. She read it, smiled dreamily, and handed it to Harry. It was
folded open to a specific article.</p>
      <p>Evidently
The Quibbler was getting into the act, and featured a historical
piece on Sirius's imprisonment, pointing out the many
irregularities in how his case was tried - or rather wasn't. What
surprised Harry was the straightforward and non-fanciful nature of
the article. It had a clear time-line of the events, a well-written
legal breakdown, and not a single mention of Crumple-Horned
Snorkacks. Harry just stared at Luna.</p>
      <p>"I
told father about the article," she said. "He doesn't normally
like to carry stories like this, but he's annoyed at the Ministry
for suppressing his expose about their secret alliance with the
Vampire clans."</p>
      <p>Harry
didn't even react, he just handed the paper to Hermione when she
began to sputter. Ron muffled a suspicious-sounding cough as Ginny
elbowed him.</p>
      <p>"That
was a nice thing to do," Neville said quietly.</p>
      <p>Luna
turned toward him, her eyes seeming to look right past him. Neville
cleared his throat. "The five of you have acted much nicer than
anyone else I've ever met. It's very strange not being treated as
a freak, but I think I prefer it." She went back to eating her
breakfast as Neville just gaped at her.</p>
      <p>"This
is really well-researched," Hermione said in a subdued tone. Harry
supposed she felt compelled to offer an olive branch. She'd been
less than interested the last couple of times Luna had shown her an
article from her father's newspaper.</p>
      <p>Luna
turned and cocked her head at Hermione. "It's not very
interesting, I suppose, but public service announcements seldom are."</p>
      <p>"Public
service announcements?" Ginny asked her friend. Sharing classes had
brought the girls even closer together.</p>
      <p>"The
public should know what sorts of people are running the Ministry,
shouldn't they? You would think the Vampire Alliance would install
smarter puppets though." Luna asked in an absent-minded tone before
she resumed eating.</p>
      <p>On
Saturday, Oliver delayed their normal practice until after the
photographers had captured the Gryffindor Lions in all their glory.
The men from the Nimbus Racing Broom Company were there as well, and
were rather excited about the whole thing. One man did ask Harry to
autograph a proof for his son, which made him a little uncomfortable.
The Boy Who Lived sucked it up and smiled as he wrote, but then
passed the photograph to Oliver and the rest of the team to sign it
as well. The man chuckled as he received the picture back, but he
also nodded to Harry as if to say he understood.</p>
      <p>Oliver
was so happy about the new brooms that he even let them slack off for
the rest of the practice. In truth, they all needed to do some casual
flying to get used to the new brooms. The Weasley Twins were
especially exuberant; Oliver forced them to stay serious throughout
the photography session on pain of death, or worse - expulsion from
the team. Now they were seeing exactly how fast their new brooms
could go as they buzzed the stands.</p>
      <p>The
icing on the cake, however, came the following Monday. Nimbus had a
very large advertisement on the third page of the Daily Prophet. It
featured a picture of the Gryffindor Lions, lined up with their
brooms and looking very serious, with the caption "Nimbus Racing
Brooms - Proud Sponsors of the Gryffindor Lions, 1992 Quidditch Cup
Champions!"</p>
      <p>Oliver
posed with Fred and George on either side of him, not trusting to let
them out of his sight. It worked for the most part. But every so
often, one of the twins in the photograph would smirk and reaching
back, use two fingers to put 'rabbit ears' on Oliver.</p>
      <p>If
Oliver was upset by this, he didn't show it. Harry supposed he was
used to them by now.</p>
      <p>Draco
Malfoy, however, was a bit more demonstrative. He stomped up behind
Harry and threw his newspaper down on the table, narrowly missing the
bacon. "Who the hell do you think you are, Potter?"</p>
      <p>"I
think you just answered your own question, Malfoy," Harry replied
coolly as he turned back to his plate.</p>
      <p>"He's
just mad that the playing field got levelled," Ron observed sagely.
"Now he actually might have to rely on his own skills, and he's
terrified." He was also turned slightly so he could see the
blond-haired Slytherin and his omnipresent bodyguards.</p>
      <p>"At
least I'm on a team," Draco sneered.</p>
      <p>"Bought
your way on, rather," Hermione corrected him.</p>
      <p>"Defending
your... boyfriend, Granger? I supposed your sort would have to settle
for a pauper."</p>
      <p>Ginny
immediately grabbed Ron's arm. The last thing they needed was an
altercation with all the professors at the high table watching. Draco
scowled and Harry knew the boy was hoping for more of a reaction.
Harry glanced over at the Slytherin table. While Crabbe and Goyle
were flanking Draco as usual, some of the other young snakes were
watching to goings-on at the Gryffindor table. Many of them had their
hands in their pockets.</p>
      <p>Draco
must have been disappointed by the lack of reaction, because he
switched targets. "I see you've recruited Loony Lovegood for your
little band of misfits, Potter. What's the matter, Lovegood? Do you
have no sense at all, or are you just that pathetically desperate for
friends?"</p>
      <p>"Shut
up Malfoy!" Neville snarled. The normally soft-spoken boy's voice
echoed through the Great Hall. "She's worth ten of you!"</p>
      <p>Harry
felt a chill go down his spine. <em>That was downright peculiar,
hearing that come out of Neville's mouth. </em></p>
      <p>Luna
just smiled absently at Draco, which seemed to provoke him even more.</p>
      <p>"Nothing
to say, Lovegood? Lost your tongue? Or... lost your mind?" At the
last part, Draco gave Neville a nasty leer.</p>
      <p>Harry
watched as the blood drained out his friend's face. In a flash
Neville was standing, then he leaped onto the table, stepping on a
platter of scrambled eggs. The next instant he was airborne, and
landed on Draco Malfoy like a ton of bricks, slamming the boy to the
floor. Neville's elbows were working like pistons and he pounded
Draco's face several times before Crabbe and Goyle even thought to
do anything. Several Slytherin students jumped up with wands in their
hands, but Neville and his target were out of their line of sight.
Harry palmed his wand while Ron grabbed Goyle's leg before he could
kick Neville in the head.</p>
      <p>Things
were starting to spiral out of control when Professor Dumbledore's
wand let out a noise like a crack of thunder, making everyone jump.
Professor Snape was already moving, with McGonagall half a step
behind him. Harry and Ron helped pull Neville to his feet while
Crabbe and Goyle belatedly helped their leader.</p>
      <p>Draco
looked like he'd been run over by a herd of Hippogriffs. One eye
was blackened and swelling shut, while the other was blinking and
unfocused. Both nostrils were bloody and he had a badly split lip.</p>
      <p>Professor
Snape took one look at Draco and spun toward the Gryffindors. His
wand was in his hand and for an instant Harry thought he was going to
hex them. Harry's own wand was in a white-knuckled grip and he was
a split second from screaming "Protego!" at the top of his lungs.
Being the first to use magic, even a defensive spell, would not help
them.</p>
      <p>Everything
hung in the balance until Snape mastered his rage. "This conduct is
inexcusable! Thirty points from Gryffindor and a week's detention,
Longbottom."</p>
      <p>"He
was provoked!" Ron protested. "Malfoy came over here to pick a
fight. You're just mad that he got one!"</p>
      <p>Snape's
face got even redder, but he was cut off before he could say
anything.</p>
      <p>"While
there should not have been any violence, I would like to know what
comments precipitated this incident, Mr. Malfoy." Professor
Dumbledore's voice was calm, but it nonetheless seemed to carry a
slight edge to it.</p>
      <p>Draco
hesitated. Harry knew that to someone aware of what happened to Frank
and Alice Longbottom, Draco's remarks were beyond the pale. They
were especially unforgivable since Draco's aunt Bellatrix was one
of the ones responsible for their condition, and was serving a life
sentence in Azkaban for it. "I'm certain I don't understand
what you mean, Headmaster."</p>
      <p>Dumbledore
nodded slowly, and Harry wondered if he was using Legilimency on the
boy. <em>Not my problem,</em> Harry concluded wryly. "Very well, Mr.
Malfoy," Dumbledore agreed, "If your words were so shameful that
you can't repeat them, then I believe that thirty points should be
deducted from Slytherin as well. Don't you agree, Professor Snape?"</p>
      <p>"I...
see, Headmaster," Snape agreed, looking like he'd just eaten a
whole lemon.</p>
      <p>"Very
well. We should all return to our respective seats before our
breakfast is completely cold. Mr. Longbottom, you will report to
Professor Sprout after dinner tonight to begin your detention."</p>
      <p>Neville
coughed. "Yes sir." Harry knew that working for Professor Sprout
was far more preferable than whatever Snape would have him doing.</p>
      <p>The
atmosphere was subdued after that. Neville was looking down at his
plate, probably thinking about his parents. Everyone else was trying
to make light conversation and not draw any more attention to his
reaction, with one exception.</p>
      <p>Harry
noticed that Luna was staring at Neville. This wasn't one of her
usual vacant stares. In fact, she was looking at him quite intently.
She seemed to be frowning, which was almost impossible for her. He
ate mechanically, watching this unusually focused Luna. Ginny nudged
him under the table and he nodded fractionally to indicate he'd
noticed. Hermione was still explaining to Ron how Muggle athletes
used product endorsements.</p>
      <p>Harry
pondered Luna's latest behaviour as they left for their morning
classes. He was about to tap her on the shoulder and just ask her, an
approach which worked about a third of the time, when she murmured
something. She was probably just talking to herself, and if Harry had
been any farther away he would undoubtedly have missed her
whispering, "At least I won't have to change my initials."</p>
      <p>Harry
tripped on the stairs and almost crashed into her.</p>
      <p>He
cleared his throat as he recovered. He smiled as Ginny dragged a very
distracted Luna off to their morning class. <em>Well, </em>he mused,
<em>Neville might not have slain a dragon, but he did pound the crap
out of a Draco.</em></p>
