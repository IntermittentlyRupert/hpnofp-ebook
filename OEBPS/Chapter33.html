    <h2><em>Destructive Impulses</em></h2>
    <div class="storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy" id="storytext">
      <p>In
Harry's defence, it could be said that familiarity with his
nightmares had worn some of the corners off of them. When one has the
same dream repeatedly over the course of a couple of years, some
details tend to become slightly blurred. But the Boggart's magic
didn't care about familiarity and didn't care about the passage
of time. The creature's unique magical defence seized on the
strongest negatively-associated image in Harry's mind and
reproduced it in exquisite, loving detail for its victim.</p>
      <p>Harry's
breath froze in his lungs as he saw an older Ginny sprawled dead on
the desk. Details that hadn't consciously registered that horrible
day were reproduced down to the last spatter of blood. The
artificially pale face, robbed of all circulation; the bones
protruding from her wand arm, the stub of wood still clenched between
two fingers; the broken and bent legs; the shredded and burned robe.
Glimpses of torn underclothes.</p>
      <p>Harry's
wand was in his hand, but it was shaking so hard he couldn't raise
it. He knew he was supposed to come up with a way to make this
humorous, to <em>laugh</em>
at it, but there wasn't anything remotely funny in his mind right
now. He clamped down on his Occlumency shields, trying to rob the
Boggart of any input. The image wavered slightly as he heard the
scrape of desks around him beginning to move.</p>
      <p>Out
of the corner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin lunge towards him,
clearly trying to distract the Boggart. He'd taken two steps,
dodging around the desks moving away from Harry. He almost reached
the Boy Who Lived before something unseen flung him toward the
doorway with stunning force.</p>
      <p>Suddenly
Ginny was replaced by a sprawled corpse, mangled beyond recognition,
only a few tufts of short red hair visible through the blood and gore
that covered the head. Harry gritted his teeth as Ron's corpse was
replaced with an older version of Hermione, face deathly pale, but
with her throat a red ruin that cascaded down to cover her blouse. It
took a moment for Harry to realize that the animal growl he heard was
coming from himself. Then Luna and Neville appeared in quick
succession, their eyes glassy from the Killing Curse. Then a final
figure that wasn't dead.</p>
      <p>The
red-slitted eyes locked onto Harry's as Voldemort's victorious
smirk spread across his features. The red silken robes rustled as the
Dark Lord almost lazily raised his wand, the green glow of the
Killing Curse already lighting the tip.</p>
      <p>"I've
already won, Potter," it seemed to hiss as Harry's scar exploded
with well-remembered pain.</p>
      <p>"NO!"
Harry screamed at the top of his lungs. "<em>Singularis
Nex!" </em>
he roared, the simple Boggart-banishing hex forgotten. The
much-abused student desks, already pushed back to the walls,
shattered to kindling behind him as a mote of pure darkness shot from
his wand. Half-forgotten reflexes came to the fore and he dived and
rolled to the side to avoid the counterstroke, coming up on one knee
to blast Voldemort when he dodged Harry's initial strike...</p>
      <p>Only
to watch the ersatz Dark Lord stare in confusion at onrushing doom.
The pulsing ball of blackness travelled far slower than most curses,
but that didn't matter if its target didn't move. When it struck
the transformed Boggart it exploded with mind-numbing force and Harry
had to shield his eyes with his hand.</p>
      <p>When
Harry lowered his arm, the Boggart was gone. As was the packing case,
Professor Lupin's desk, the bookshelves, and all the other
furnishings at that end of the room. Not even dust remained on the
scorched stones, some of which showed hairline cracks.</p>
      <p>Harry
swallowed and turned, still on one knee, toward the entrance to the
classroom. With a quiet groan, Remus Lupin sat up, blinking owlishly
and rubbing at the back of his head.</p>
      <p>Harry
froze in place for a moment, heart pounding, as the rage in his heart
was abruptly replaced by chagrin.</p>
      <p><em>This
has gone utterly pear</em><em>-shaped</em>.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>Professor
Dumbledore's eyes widened behind his spectacles as he stiffened.
Professor McGonagall stared at him curiously. Professor Sprout was
just giving them, along with the Potions teacher and School Matron,
an update on the greenhouses when the Headmaster felt a disturbance
in the wards.</p>
      <p>As
the Headmaster of Hogwarts, he held ultimate control of the castle's
defences, but he was surprised his colleagues didn't themselves
feel the flare of magic that had occurred within the school.</p>
      <p>It
was their turn to jump as a low-pitched boom rumbled throughout the
castle. Professor Slughorn choked on a piece of crystallized
pineapple and began coughing.</p>
      <p>"Albus?"
Professor McGonagall asked, an eyebrow raised in concern as Madam
Pomfrey gave the round little Potion master a sharp blow to the
middle of his back.</p>
      <p>Dumbledore
rose to his feet with a speed that belied his age. "That came from
one of the classrooms," he said as he threw open the door to the
staff room. As one, the professors followed their headmaster out the
door.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>Harry
shakily climbed to his feet. Professor Lupin let out a low moan as he
cradled his head in his hands. Recalling the loud thump the man had
made when he struck the doorframe, Harry rushed over to check on him.</p>
      <p>Even
through the faded brown hair, Harry could see a large knot forming on
the back of the man's head. Head injuries were tricky, even if the
victim was still conscious, so Harry resolved to get Remus to the
hospital wing quick sticks.</p>
      <p>"Let's
get you to Madam Pomfrey, Professor," Harry said quietly as he got
a good grip on the defence professor's shoulder. Remus started to
nod, but winced instead. His eyes screwed shut with pain.</p>
      <p>As
he helped Remus blindly climb to his feet, Harry couldn't help but
glance at the devastated classroom. He knew a few charms like <em>Reparo</em>,
but this would take...</p>
      <p>"Just
give me a moment, Harry," Remus said in a shaky voice. His eyes
were slitted as if the light hurt them.</p>
      <p>Harry
paused as Remus slowly tested his balance. Dobby hadn't ended up at
The Burrow, so he assumed the house-elf had found employment
elsewhere. He just hoped he was correct in his assumption.</p>
      <p>"Dobby?"
he whispered urgently.</p>
      <p>With
a quiet pop, the former Malfoy servant appeared before them.</p>
      <p>"Harry
Potter, sir, calls Dobby?" the elf asked hopefully; joy alight in
his bulging eyes.</p>
      <p>"Er,
yeah," Harry said quickly. "I guess you found a job here at
Hogwarts?" he asked.</p>
      <p>Dobby
nodded quickly, making his long ears flop. "Headmaster says Dobby
may not be welcome where Harry Potter stays, but Headmaster offers
Dobby a <em>job</em>.
Headmaster pays Dobby three Sickles a month, but Dobby is free to
quit if he wants."</p>
      <p>Harry
frowned for a moment, wondering why the Headmaster had said such a
thing, then he realized that Molly might not have been comfortable
being displaced in her duties at The Burrow. Not to mention having
Dobby do some of the chores might leave Fred and George more time for
mischief... Harry shook his head - there was no time for this now.</p>
      <p>"Glad
to hear that,
Dobby," he said quickly. "Look, we've had a bit of an accident
here. I'm going to take Professor Lupin to the hospital wing to get
his head looked at. Would you mind, er, helping with the mess in
here?"</p>
      <p>Dobby
looked at the wrecked classroom, from the shattered desks to the
scorched flagstones at the other end, and his eyes grew even wider.
"Harry Potter, sir, is indeed a great and powerful wizard," he
whispered, and Harry felt his stomach twist, but he supposed Dobby
had cleaned up spell damage at Malfoy Manor more than once. The
house-elf turned back to Harry and squared his shoulders with comical
determination. "Dobby will fix it."</p>
      <p>"Good
thinking, Harry," Remus murmured. "I'd hate to explain any more
of this than I have to," he said in an embarrassed tone. "Not one
of my finer moments as a teacher..."</p>
      <p>Harry
felt a bit warmed inside that his tutor didn't seem to be blaming
him for what happened, but he was still worried that the man was hurt
worse than he seemed to be. There would be time to worry about what
he'd seen and how to explain it later.</p>
      <p>But
Professor Lupin's luck seemed to be no better than Harry's
lately. They'd barely made the first cross-corridor before
encountering the Headmaster and several professors.</p>
      <p>"Mr.
Potter?" McGonagall asked, her voice rising slightly in alarm.</p>
      <p>"We,
uh, had an accident," Harry said quickly. "Professor Lupin hit
his head."</p>
      <p>Madam
Pomfrey immediately stepped forward, her wand out. After making a few
passes over the man's head, she nodded. "He's got a mild
concussion, but if he can walk on his own, it's safe to move him to
the hospital wing. I can deal with this better there."</p>
      <p>"Perhaps
we should all go there," Professor Dumbledore suggested in a mild
voice. Harry could only nod wordlessly.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>Madam
Pomfrey had Professor Lupin resting comfortably on one of the
infirmary beds. After a couple of quick diagnostic charms, she handed
him two potions in a manner that brooked no nonsense. Lupin drank
them both without a word, and Harry was reminded that she'd been
the Matron when Lupin was a student at Hogwarts. Obeying her was no
doubt still a habit!</p>
      <p>Once
the man had drained the last vial, grimacing at an evidently
unpleasant aftertaste, his eyes had cleared and he once again seemed
fully aware.</p>
      <p>"Remus,"
Dumbledore said gently, "how did you come to be injured?"</p>
      <p>Harry
felt his face flush with shame. However inadvertent, Moony's
injuries had still been caused by his magic.</p>
      <p>Remus
glanced at Harry and shook his head. "Mostly my own fault. You see,
Harry missed the class where I covered Boggarts. I wasn't sure
having him confront one during the regular class was a good idea, but
I did want to make sure he was familiar with the effects of their
glamour, and knew the counter-charm."</p>
      <p>"Are
you always in the habit of holding private revision sessions for
students that miss your regular class?" Professor McGonagall asked
in an arch tone that made Harry wince. He knew that she still
harboured some reservations regarding Remus and his extracurricular
summer work with Harry and the others. She was scrupulously fair,
showing no favour in the classroom toward her own house, so any signs
of favouritism by others would be met with clear disapproval.</p>
      <p>Harry
knew the strict professor had been Remus' Head of House when he'd
attended Hogwarts - deferring to her would be even more ingrained
than with Madam Pomfrey.</p>
      <p>So
he was mildly surprised when Professor Lupin locked gazes with the
Deputy Headmistress and said quietly. "There are reasons that I
need to ensure Harry excels in my subject, but I am not at liberty to
speak of them." The other teachers looked curious about the vague
pronouncement, but McGonagall immediately let the issue drop.</p>
      <p>"I
see," said Dumbledore. "But if Harry was confronting a Boggart,
how did you come to be hit by his spell?"</p>
      <p>"I
wasn't," Lupin admitted with a wan smile. "I was caught in the
backlash when Harry destroyed it."</p>
      <p>Harry
stared down at his feet as he felt his cheeks burn. He was startled
when he felt Lupin's hand close around his shoulder. "I saw a
young woman with red hair. Was it Lily?" he asked, but continued
after Harry didn't answer. "It affected Harry greatly, but as I
moved to dispel it, I think I was caught in a burst of accidental
magic. I am quite sure that Harry's wand did not move, so this was
not intentional."</p>
      <p>Harry
still couldn't make himself look up. After the dream he'd had
about Dumbledore at The Burrow, the idea of losing control of his
magic horrified him almost as much as thinking about the future.</p>
      <p>"Was
that what caused the explosion we heard?" Professor Dumbledore
asked in a quiet voice. For an instant, Harry wanted to tell him
everything, lay all the cards on the table, and let someone else be
responsible for this whole mess. But would that just be taking the
easy way out?</p>
      <p>"No,
Headmaster," Remus said, and Harry thought his voice sounded very
odd. "I looked up just in time to realize that the Boggart had made
a fatal error."</p>
      <p>Now
Harry did look up. Remus had a tight grin on his face that seemed to
melt years off of his appearance, and Harry remembered that he was a
Marauder, after all. "I know none of the approved modern magical
history books carry an accurate depiction of what Voldemort really
looked like, but given Harry's curiosity and resources, I don't
doubt that he's read one that did. The Boggart decided to take on
that appearance, and it was the last mistake it ever made."</p>
      <p>"Harry
Banished it?" Professor McGonagall asked curiously.</p>
      <p>"Harry
<em>obliterated
</em>it,"
Professor Lupin corrected. "I daresay my desk will never be the
same."</p>
      <p>Harry
resisted the urge to remind them that he was standing right there. He
also realized that Lupin's concussion prevented him from fully
realizing what had happened. There was no desk anymore. He hoped
Dobby was able to do something...</p>
      <p>"Harry,"
Dumbledore said in a serious voice that seized Harry's attention,
"I understand that you may have been startled, but with great power
comes great responsibility."</p>
      <p>Harry
frowned. Where had he heard that before?</p>
      <p>"It
seems," Dumbledore continued, "that your magic may be stronger
than many of your peers. That means you need to be careful or you
risk inadvertently harming one of your friends."</p>
      <p>Harry
swallowed thickly. Dumbledore was layering on the guilt, and he knew
it, but it still worked. Harry nodded. "I didn't intend for that
to happen," he said truthfully.</p>
      <p>"I'm
aware of that, Harry," Dumbledore said, "but you need to be
careful to make sure it doesn't happen again."</p>
      <p>Harry
just nodded. He didn't want to prolong the discussion. He was both
worn out and wary of letting something slip. Had Remus seen more than
he said?</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>By
the time Harry was allowed to return to Gryffindor Tower, dinner was
long over, but his appetite was nowhere to be found. His only
consolation was that Professor Lupin didn't seem to be seriously
injured by his lack of control. He claimed his headache was gone, and
only stayed overnight in the hospital wing at Madam Pomfrey's firm
insistence.</p>
      <p>He
noticed several people look up as he stepped past the Fat Lady's
portrait. His friends were clustered around a couple of sofas in the
corner of the common room, so he made his way there with some relief.</p>
      <p>Ginny
frowned when she got a good look at his expression, but Hermione
spoke up first. "Harry, what's wrong?"</p>
      <p>When
he didn't immediately answer, the others began to look more and
more concerned, so he held up his hands in a placating gesture and
glanced around the common area. Seamus and Dean were on the other
side of the room, playing Exploding Snap with some second-year boys.
"Let's discuss this upstairs," he said quietly.</p>
      <p>With
that, they packed up their school books and made their way up to the
third-year boys' room. Harry brought up the rear, quietly palming
his wand. He didn't place locking or privacy charms on the door as
it shut - that would have lead to all sorts of inappropriate
speculation among their classmates - but he did perform a silent
Warning Charm that would alert him if anyone approached the door.</p>
      <p>The
girls looked around curiously. While they were not barred from the
boys' dormitories - though the opposite was certainly true -
they hadn't been up there very often.</p>
      <p>Harry
sat on his bed, hung his head, and ran his hands through his hair. He
barely registered Ginny sitting next to him before she laid a cool
hand on the back of his neck. He tensed for a moment before he made
himself relax. With her silent encouragement, he told them everything
that had happened that disastrous afternoon.</p>
      <p>When
he concluded with how he'd finally been allowed to leave the
hospital wing, he waited for them to react. A scolding from Hermione
or Ginny he'd expect. An odd comment from Luna was only par for the
course. An amused snort from Neville was enough to make him look up
in surprise.</p>
      <p>"You
sure showed that Boggart, mate," Ron said, his smirk disturbingly
reminiscent of the twins.</p>
      <p>"Don't
you get it?" Harry demanded. "I could have given everything
away!"</p>
      <p>"It
actually may not be that bad," Hermione said thoughtfully.
"Professor Lupin appears to have only seen the first body, and
thought it might have been your mother, instead of an older Ginny."</p>
      <p>Harry
stole a sideways glance at Ginny. Her face was a little red, but she
said nothing. Her hand stayed on the back of his neck. He supposed
she knew how his older counterpart had felt about losing that other
Ginny, but he was still uncomfortable when events reminded her of it.</p>
      <p>"And
then he saw Harry blowing up Voldemort," Luna added dreamily. Then
she smiled. "That was probably very reassuring," she added
brightly.</p>
      <p>"No
doubt," Neville agreed.</p>
      <p>"I
can't believe you are all making jokes about this," Harry
snapped, his voice a little harsher than he intended. Ginny huffed
and her hand tightened on the back of his neck for a moment. He
froze.</p>
      <p>Her
hand began kneading the tense muscles and he found himself relaxing
in spite of himself. Her voice, on the other hand, was rather crisp.
"Whether we make jokes about it doesn't matter one bit. But I do
think you are overreacting, and I'm not the only one, Harry."</p>
      <p>"Harry,"
Hermione began in a placating tone, "my father is rather fond of
saying that when you hear hoof beats outside, it could be zebras, but
most likely it's just horses. In most instances, the simplest
explanation is the best. These clues may seem obvious to you because
you already know the truth. But try to put yourself in their shoes
for a moment. The research on temporal transit fields won't be
published for several years and there are explanations that are far
easier to accept for what they have seen."</p>
      <p>Harry
frowned at the bushy-haired witch. "What do you mean?" he asked.</p>
      <p>"Professor
Lupin saw you confronted with the dead body of a red-haired young
woman," Hermione began in her 'explaining to my friends' voice.
"The only red-haired young <em>woman</em>
he knows of with a connection to you is your mother. He assumed it
was what he knew, rather than speculating about something else -
like an older version of Ginny."</p>
      <p>Harry
nodded slowly, her words reassuring him in spite of himself.</p>
      <p>"And
when you destroyed the image of Voldemort," Hermione continued, "he
apparently assumed it was because he'd killed your parents. Again,
people tend to go with what they already know, rather than looking
for something else. I don't mean to make light of your concerns,
Harry, but it may not be as dire as it seems."</p>
      <p>Harry
nodded slowly and blew out a shaky breath. He couldn't fault
Hermione's logic, and Ginny's mostly-silent persuasion was no
less effective.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>By
the time the Headmaster and Deputy Headmistress returned to staff
room, the concerns about the state of the greenhouses were the
farthest from their minds. Madam Pomfrey, of course, stayed behind to
keep an eye on her new patient. Professors Slughorn and Sprout
exchanged a glance before suggesting they meet later on in the week.</p>
      <p>The
door had barely closed before Professor McGonagall turned to the
Headmaster with a raised eyebrow.</p>
      <p>"A
most unusual disruption to what promised to be a fairly tedious
meeting," he said.</p>
      <p>"Is
that all you can say?" she asked in deceptively mild tone.</p>
      <p>"We
should probably survey the damage to the Defence classroom before
drawing any conclusions," he said thoughtfully, stroking his beard,
"but I feel it is safe to say that young Harry may be a bit more
powerful than we were led to believe."</p>
      <p>McGonagall
nodded. "He certainly did not display anything like what Professor
Lupin implied during Duelling Association meetings."</p>
      <p>"I
find it troubling that he seems to be concealing his true
capabilities," Professor Dumbledore said with a frown.</p>
      <p>McGonagall
gave him a sharp look. "Are you still looking for parallels that
don't exist?" she asked in a tone that brooked no nonsense.</p>
      <p>"What
reason would he have for doing so?" Dumbledore asked, "He also
seemed very upset that he'd been caught out."</p>
      <p>The
Deputy Headmistress shook her head in exasperation. "I think he was
more upset by the injury to Professor Lupin. If you will recall,
Remus and James were very good friends. I would not be surprised if
Harry saw him as a link to his own father."</p>
      <p>Dumbledore
nodded. "A friendship that did credit to James, even if it did put
him at odds with his father for some time. Do you think Harry is that
attached to him?"</p>
      <p>"Harry
seems to be very focused on getting to know his parents' friends,"
she said carefully. "You saw the interview he gave regarding Mr.
Black."</p>
      <p>Dumbledore
winced. "Minister Fudge is still quite agitated about Harry's
accusations. He wants me to restrict owl post to Mr. Potter within
the castle and not allow him to visit Hogsmeade with the other third
years."</p>
      <p>McGonagall
scowled. "I hope you are not planning to accede to his requests,"
she said frostily. "No good will come of punishing the boy when he
has done no wrong," she warned.</p>
      <p>"I'm
not sure the Minister would agree," Dumbledore said carefully, "but
to Harry, he is just using all the means at his disposal to see his
godfather cleared." He shook his head. "I did not agree to act on
the Minister's behalf with regards to Harry, but Cornelius sees
this as a base betrayal on my part. I fear that there is a great deal
of tension between the Ministry and Hogwarts at the moment."</p>
      <p>"Is
that why you agreed to them posting Dementors around a school full of
children?" McGonagall asked.</p>
      <p>"They
are not actually on the grounds," Dumbledore pointed out in a
pained voice. "But yes, with these alleged sightings in Hogsmeade,
I can't really interfere in an ongoing manhunt. I fear that
Cornelius wants the man Kissed as soon as he is brought in, if only
to head off a more thorough investigation."</p>
      <p>"But
he never even had a trial!" McGonagall objected.</p>
      <p>"True,"
Dumbledore agreed. "But by fleeing custody he is placing himself
beyond the protections afforded him by the law. There is a legal
precedent for this, should the Minister order it."</p>
      <p>McGonagall's
gaze hardened. "Then I hope, for all of our sakes, that Sirius
Black is not captured. Little else could so firmly persuade Harry
that the Ministry is his enemy... and he already has enough to deal
with if You-Know-Who returns."</p>
      <p>Dumbledore
nodded wearily, for once showing his age.</p>
      <p>As
Professor McGonagall stood up, she paused for a moment. "I'll
leave you with an additional thing to consider," she said primly.
"Last term you were concerned with how callous Mr. Potter appeared
regarding the injuries sustained by the Slytherin students who
ambushed him and his friends. Compare that with how guilt-stricken he
appeared tonight because of Professor Lupin's injuries."</p>
      <p>Dumbledore
looked up at her. "You are correct, there <em>is</em>
quite a difference."</p>
      <p>"I
think it has to do with how much he perceives they deserve it," she
observed. "Someone attacking him deserves what they get... but an
innocent bystander?"</p>
      <p>Dumbledore
smiled as he stood up. "That is an excellent observation, Minerva!
Please keep me posted on this, or anything else you observe with
respect to Harry."</p>
      <p>Seemingly
in spite of herself, the Transfiguration professor smiled at the
Headmaster's words.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>The
following morning, Remus Lupin smiled fondly at Madam Pomfrey as she
fussed over him before allowing him to return to his quarters. She'd
helped him recover from the increasingly painful transformations he'd
undergone while he was a student at Hogwarts - he doubted she'd
ever see him without being reminded of the boy who stumbled,
shivering, from the tunnel to the Shrieking Shack every full moon.</p>
      <p>Remembering
all the aches she'd soothed, he could hardly object when she wanted
to run an additional diagnostic charm, or feed him an extra potion or
two. When she finally cleared him to leave the hospital wing, he
smiled fondly at her and thanked her in a quiet voice. She flushed a
bit; evidently the difference in their heights once he stood up
reminded her that he <em>wasn't</em>
that same little boy anymore. Moony suppressed a grin as he left.
Some things never changed, and others became even better.</p>
      <p>Despite
the disastrous finale to the evening, he was considerably cheered by
what little he'd seen. Harry's confrontation with the Boggart had
the boy displaying a degree of power that he'd only hinted at over
the summer. He knew Harry was magically stronger than his friends,
but he suspected 'The-Boy-Who-Lived' was holding back -- a lot --
during their exercises.</p>
      <p>Remus
frowned as he walked down the corridor, heading for a moving
staircase. That label was probably a good piece of the reason why...
Harry was already treated as an object of curiosity by so many; it
only stood to reason that he'd want to conceal anything else that
might make him appear different. Children his age usually wanted very
badly to fit in with their peers...</p>
      <p>Remus
shook his head. He'd talk to Harry the first chance he received.
Given the task Harry had to perform in the future, having overly
strong magic was only good news. He just needed to make sure Harry
saw it as a boon, and not another burden.</p>
      <p>He
smiled wistfully. James and Lily would have been so proud of their
son.</p>
      <p>Just
being back at Hogwarts was enough to make him feel nostalgic, and
thinking about what <em>should</em>
have been was enough to occupy his thoughts until he opened the door
to his classroom.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly,
the damage wasn't nearly as bad as he'd expected. The Boggart's
crate was gone, of course, but his desk and the student desks had
been put back in their normal places. He frowned. He could have sworn
he'd heard the sound of splintering wood after he'd struck his
head, but either he'd imagined it, or it was just the crate being
destroyed. He'd barely got his eyes open again in time to see the
imitation Dark Lord annihilated by Harry's spell. And after that,
he'd been dazzled by the flashes shooting across his vision.</p>
      <p>Slowly
shaking his head, he entered the room. Hogwarts' house-elves were
as efficient as ever. His desk appeared to be freshly polished, as
were the bookshelves holding extra copies of the defence textbooks,
and someone had mended the small tear in the seat cushion of his
chair... someone that was more proficient with fabric charms than he
was, anyway.</p>
      <p>Chuckling
slightly, he looked at the clock on the wall. That, too, had been
freshly cleaned. There was still an hour before the Great Hall opened
for breakfast, so he could get some grading done on those essays.</p>
      <p>But
when he opened the left-hand drawer of his desk, he paused in
confusion. Had he moved the essays? He checked the right-hand drawer
and saw a set of quills and a fresh bottle of ink, but no papers. And
how had that bottle been re-filled?</p>
      <p>"Is
everything alright, Master Loopy?" a high-pitched voice said from
below his right elbow.</p>
      <p>Lupin
jumped with a muttered oath, almost falling out of his chair. He
twisted around and stared at a cringing house-elf who was wringing
his hands. "Who are you?" he asked, perhaps a bit sharper than he
intended.</p>
      <p>"I
is being Dobby, and I works here at Hogwarts, Master Loopy, sir.
Dobby cleaned up classroom last night. Is classroom to your liking,
sir?"</p>
      <p>Remus
forced the scowl off of his face. He vaguely remembered hearing Harry
talk to someone named Dobby when he was first recovering from his
head hitting the doorframe. The overly-servile speech of most
house-elves tended to rub him the wrong way, but he knew from his
studies that they couldn't really help it. So, he found himself
hastening to reassure the little manikin. "Oh no, everything is
fine, the room looks wonderful," he said, causing the elf to beam
with happiness. "I was just," he added diffidently, "wondering
if you knew where the essays that were in my desk went?"</p>
      <p>Dobby's
eyes went wide with horror. Before Remus could stop him, the
house-elf began slamming his head against the corner of the desk,
over and over. "Oh, Dobby is a bad elf! Dobby did not save papers
when cleaning! Dobby is so sorry! Dobby should be punished!" Every
statement was punctuated with a meaty thump of tiny skull striking
hardwood furniture.</p>
      <p>Remus
was momentarily speechless at the extreme reaction his innocent
question had caused. He reached down to stop Dobby, but the elf was
stronger than his size suggested and surprisingly persistent. "It's
all right, Dobby, I didn't really need them. I was, er, just going
to throw them out anyway... so you, ah, saved me the trouble."</p>
      <p>It
wasn't until these words sunk in that Dobby stopped thrashing and
trying to punish himself. "Professor Loopy means it?" he asked,
eyes wide.</p>
      <p>"Er,
yes," Lupin said, taken aback. "Who told you my name?"</p>
      <p>"Dobby
asks Mister Peeves," he said seriously. "Mister Peeves was very
helpful to Dobby."</p>
      <p>Lupin
winced, but refrained from commenting. "Well, no harm done. I
appreciate you cleaning up the mess from that Boggart!" he said in
what he hoped sounded like a jaunty tone.</p>
      <p>Dobby
nodded so hard his ears wobbled. "Master Loopy must let Dobby know
if his Professorness needs anything! Anything!" Then he disappeared
with a small pop.</p>
      <p>Professor
Lupin blinked and then shook his head. He closed the desk drawers and
got up from his chair, heading toward the door. He supposed the
students wouldn't be <em>too</em>
averse to him announcing they'd all received full marks for their
essays.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>Dobby
smiled as he returned to the kitchens. Harry Potter had been very
worried about the classroom when he called for Dobby. He remembered
the dark Young Master calling for him in similar circumstances. His
orders had always been <em>very
</em>clear.
Painfully clear. <em>Make
this so it looked like nothing happened. Make it so no one even
notices. If anyone does notice anything different, tell them it's
your fault!</em></p>
      <p>The
desks and chairs were easy - he had only to get spares from the
Hogwarts storage areas and fix them up, an easy job for house-elf
magic. The same applied to the book shelves and spare textbooks,
though he'd had to duplicate more than a few of those to make up
the deficit.</p>
      <p>The
student essays, though, were a different matter. They'd been
destroyed so thoroughly that his magic couldn't restore them - so
he did, in fact fail to save them. Taking the blame for that didn't
bother him, though he was surprised that Master Loopy didn't let
him punish himself more.</p>
      <p>If
he would do it for Young Master, who didn't treat him very well,
he'd certainly do it for the most wonderful Harry Potter, who'd
freed him.</p>
      <p>Dobby
was delighted to note that the preparations for breakfast were still
underway, so he could get in on those as well. Working at Hogwarts
was great fun for a house-elf, because there was always something to
do.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>Harry
was almost too embarrassed to meet Professor Lupin's eye when he
attended his next Defence Against the Dark Arts class. It got worse
when Professor Lupin asked him to stay after class.</p>
      <p>Once
the last of the other students had filed out, Professor Lupin let out
a sigh that almost sounded like he was amused. "That was not the
textbook way to dispel a Boggart, but it was certainly successful.
Full marks, Harry."</p>
      <p>Harry
visibly cringed, causing his professor to laugh. Eventually, he
relaxed as he realized the man didn't completely blame him for what
happened.</p>
      <p>After
his laughter trailed off, Lupin eyed Harry appraisingly. "You know
you have every right to be angry with how some things have happened
in your life. Don't dwell on it, don't let it consume you, but
it's all right to use that anger when you need it."</p>
      <p>Harry
looked up, and locked eyes with his father's friend. Hard green
eyes bored into faded brown ones. "It can't be good that I hate
Voldemort this much, can it?"</p>
      <p>Lupin
shook his head. "I'm not Dumbledore, Harry; I don't think
everyone can be saved. I believe there comes a time and when justice
must be meted out. I don't think anyone knows exactly how many
deaths he's caused, how many lives he's ruined. If any living
person deserves your hatred, he does."</p>
      <p>Harry
nodded slowly; feeling like a weight had been lifted. He had no idea
that Remus disagreed with the Headmaster on such a fundamental issue
- especially since it was Dumbledore's philosophy that had even
allowed Remus to attend Hogwarts in the first place. But then again,
there was an issue of choice there as well. Remus hadn't chosen to
be bitten by Fenrir Greyback. Tom Riddle chose to become Lord
Voldemort. That was all the reason in the world.</p>
      <p>As
he digested this, Remus' next question caught him off guard. "How
long have you been hiding your power?"</p>
      <p>Harry
shrugged uncomfortably. "Since first year," he admitted. "When
I saw how much stronger my spells were coming out..."</p>
      <p>Remus
nodded. "And you didn't want to show off?"</p>
      <p>Harry
shrugged again. "A little; I also didn't want to advertise too
much. There are a lot of unfriendly eyes around here." </p>
      <p>Remus
nodded, conceding the point. "Be that as it may, I think we should
work on that a little. We need to gauge exactly how strong you are,
and then help you deal with it. Do you ever have problems controlling
your magic?"</p>
      <p>Harry
shook his head. "Not unless I am angry or really upset."</p>
      <p>"Then
it would be a good idea for you to make sure you are always in
control of your emotions," Remus replied thoughtfully. "Do the
Occlumency exercises help?" he asked.</p>
      <p>"Some,"
Harry allowed. "If I remember to do them in time," he added
ruefully.</p>
      <p>Remus
smiled thinly. "That's always the case," he agreed. "I would
also add that talking about things that are bothering you can be a
great help. You are both unusually mature and unusually
self-contained for a wizard of your age, Harry. I don't say this to
make you uncomfortable, but if you keep things bottled up too much,
when you do let the cork out you may go further than you intended."</p>
      <p>Harry
peered at Professor Lupin. While some of the man's observations
were uncomfortably perceptive, his advice had the sound of painful
experience to it. "Did that ever happen to you?" he asked.</p>
      <p>Remus
looked startled for a moment. "Yes, in a way. But I had friends who
kept me from going too far. Given the... circumstances... we find
ourselves in, I understand if you are hesitant to tell me too much.
But I hope you do confide in someone. Even speaking about your
problems to another person can ease the burden."</p>
      <p>Harry
looked away and nodded. Remus had evidently intuited that there were
some things Harry wasn't comfortable with the Headmaster knowing.
But he was being so understanding that it shamed Harry, just a
little. But the simple fact was that coming clean with his friends
<em>had</em>
been an enormous relief. Talking with Ginny later had been even more
cathartic. "I understand," he said finally.</p>
      <p>"Good
man," Remus said. "In that, you seem to be more like Lily than
James."</p>
      <p>Harry
looked up sharply at that.</p>
      <p>"Your
mum was a bit more sensible about things than James was. I dearly
loved them both, but there were times when only Lily could talk sense
to James," the professor explained with a fond smile. "Although
academically you take after your mother, you still seem to have
James' propensity for getting into trouble."</p>
      <p>Harry
rolled his eyes at that, but he couldn't prevent the pleased smile
that crossed his face.</p>
      <p>"All
I would ask of you, Harry," Remus continued, "is that you
exercise that Evans common sense and ask for help when you need it.
For my part, I think it would be productive if we did some exercises
to see just how much more powerful you can make your spells..."</p>
      <p>Harry
listened as Remus explained... all the awkwardness between them
forgotten.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>The
remainder of September passed far more quietly, for which Harry was
grateful. His electives, Ancient Runes and Arithmancy, proved to be
very engrossing. Neither Professor Vector nor Professor Addams were
slouches in the classroom, and both witches were very focused on
their subjects. As a result, Harry found himself being challenged
more than in any of the other classes. Ron and Neville were equally
swamped trying to keep up with the material.</p>
      <p>Hermione,
on the other hand, seemed to be enjoying every minute of it.</p>
      <p>She
was so enthused about what they were learning in their electives that
she wanted to talk about it all of the time... and Harry realized how
disappointed that <em>other</em>
Hermione must have been when both of her best friends stuck with
Divination. Unfortunately, her enthusiasm was driving Ron spare.</p>
      <p>One
day, Harry found his friend in the common room, cradling his head in
his hands over a half-finished essay on Norse runic alphabets. "I'm
not sure I can take this anymore," the redhead said in a low moan.
"I keep getting my languages crossed up, and Hermione, she thinks
this is simple! She keeps going on about this and I'll show her a
futhark..."</p>
      <p>Harry
coughed as he swallowed a laugh. "Ron, if you're struggling, just
ask her for help."</p>
      <p>Ron's
head snapped up like it was on a spring. "And then she'll think
I'm stupid!"</p>
      <p>"No
more than me, mate," Harry said, and then paused, frowning. "You
haven't asked her a single question, have you?"</p>
      <p>"No,"
Ron said as he rubbed at his eyes.</p>
      <p>"Then
she probably thinks you understand all this and find it as easy as
she does," Harry said in a low voice as he saw Hermione start to
come down the stairs. "Did you think she was thick-headed when you
were helping her get comfortable on a broom?"</p>
      <p>Ron
stared at him for a moment as Hermione sat down. Then he cleared his
throat. "Uh, Hermione, could you take a look at this for a moment?
I'm having a bad time keeping these Norse ones straight."</p>
      <p>Harry
smothered a grin as Hermione enthusiastically went through Ron's
notes, correcting a couple of things and showing him some simple
mnemonics she'd developed to help keep them straight in <em>her</em>
head. After a moment, Harry pulled out a quill and copied them down
as well.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>With
the difficulty of their electives, October and the start of the
Quidditch season was a welcome distraction to Harry, Ron, and
Neville. Their early morning training had kept them fit, and Oliver's
speech about bringing home the Cup "one last time" before he left
Hogwarts forever got everyone fired up, even on the reserve squad.</p>
      <p>The
whole team was training three evenings a week and Harry got to see
some of the changes he'd missed at the end of the last season.
Ginny rejoined the Chasers with nary a word about her absences last
term. Ron was receiving a lot of personal coaching from Oliver, who
evidently wanted a sure hand in his position after he left.</p>
      <p>But
most surprising was Neville and his progress under Fred and George.
Harry didn't think those two could take anything seriously, but
he'd severely underestimated the Weasley Quidditch spirit. During
one of the first practices, they asked Harry to help them with 'a
game of keep-away'.</p>
      <p>In
retrospect, Harry should have known better than to agree without
getting all the details. Their little practice game consisted of Fred
and George parking on their brooms about twenty yards to each side of
Harry, then Summoning a quartet of charmed Bludgers and slamming them
at Harry as hard as they could manage.</p>
      <p>Now
normally, this might have been a good bit of sport, but Harry wasn't
allowed to dodge - not even the slightest bit. Neville, armed with
a spare Beater's bat, was supposed to guard Harry and 'keep all
the Bludgers away'. Neville looked a bit green when he saw Fred
release the Bludgers and shot Harry an anxious look. At that point,
Harry didn't dare say a word, or Neville would think he didn't
trust him.</p>
      <p>So
Harry sat, cringing, on his broom as Fred and George ran Neville
ragged over the course of ten minutes. He'd lost count of the
number of cracks of bat on Bludger he'd heard before he realized
that Neville was really doing it.</p>
      <p>Red-faced
and sweating, squinting with concentration, Neville zoomed around
Harry in a tight orbit. His right arm was nearly a constant blur of
motion as he fended off the Bludgers. Harry stared, amazed, until
Neville's arm began to slow and Oliver blew his whistle.</p>
      <p>"'Ere
now, that's enough of that, you two!" he yelled from the goals.
George pulled out his wand to Banish the Bludgers back to the case
and Neville sagged in relief.</p>
      <p>Oliver
began to chew out the twins as they headed for the lockers, demanding
to know why they'd endangered their Seeker for a practice exercise
this early in the season.</p>
      <p>"Well,
Ollie," Fred said in a jovial tone, "we thought Neville here
could use the motivation. He's never got past handling two at once,
you know."</p>
      <p>Harry
swallowed and turned to look at Neville, who still had that sickly
smile on his face.</p>
      <p>Ginny
spun toward her brothers, narrowing her eyes. "You two are
unbelievable! If you injure Harry, I'll... I'll..."</p>
      <p>"You'll
what?" George asked, looking puzzled.</p>
      <p>Ginny
inhaled sharply. "I'll owl Mum," she replied softly.</p>
      <p>George,
Fred, <em>and</em>
Ron all froze in their tracks. "You wouldn't," Fred gasped,
horrified.</p>
      <p>"Don't
try me," Ginny snapped. Harry made a point of sitting next to Ginny
as they studied later that evening, and her mood seemed to improve
slightly.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>At
breakfast the following morning, most of the older students were
talking about the first Hogsmeade weekend that had just been
announced. Harry was looking forward to getting out for a while, but
was acutely aware that, as second years, Ginny and Luna would not be
allowed to go. Rather than beat around the bush, he simply asked
Ginny if she had a list yet.</p>
      <p>"List?"
she asked, frowning in confusion.</p>
      <p>"Yeah,
anything you want from Hogsmeade?" he asked. "I thought I might
pop down there for a bit and check out the shops, anything you need?"
He was purposefully downplaying an event that most of his classmates
were eagerly anticipating.</p>
      <p>Of
course, he didn't fool her for a minute, but Ginny grinned
appreciatively nonetheless. "I'll think about it. I might need
some quills."</p>
      <p>Harry
didn't even have time to look at Neville before his friend had
haltingly asked the same question of Luna. The blond girl patted his
arm fondly and said she'd let him know.</p>
      <p>Their
meal was interrupted when a tawny owl dropped a bright red envelope
in front of Neville. The Howler immediately began smoking and Neville
flinched back in spite of himself.</p>
      <p>"You
better get it over with, mate," Ron commiserated as he covered his
ears.</p>
      <p>With
a grimace, Neville ripped open the envelope.</p>
      <p>"Neville
Longbottom!" the paper snapped as it emerged, "When I give you
instructions, I expect them to be followed!" it continued in an
overly loud version of Augusta Longbottom's voice. "When Mrs.
Stebbins told me you were still hanging around with-"</p>
      <p>At
this point, Harry had heard more than enough. He stabbed his wand at
the enchanted missive and spat, "<em>Finite
Incantatem!"</em>
He knew that normal Howlers were enchanted to react badly if the
recipient tried to hex them... so he pushed more power into the spell
and tried to visualize cancelling all the enchantments on the paper
at once.</p>
      <p>The
Howler cut off in mid-tirade and poofed into a small pile of dust.
The nearest candle dimmed for a moment as well, but Harry tried to
ignore that as he looked up.</p>
      <p>Luna's
face had gone very still. She clearly didn't need anyone to tell
her that she was the point of that message. After a moment, she rose
to her feet and left the Great Hall.</p>
      <p>Neville's
face, on the other hand, was quite different. It had started off
pale, and filled with chagrin, embarrassed at being called onto the
carpet in front of the entire school. But his eyes followed Luna as
she walked away and suddenly it was like a switch was thrown. His
face flushed and he spun toward the Hufflepuff table, glaring.</p>
      <p>Harry
saw an older boy snickering with his friends as Ron grabbed Neville's
sleeve, preventing him from standing up. "Neville!" Hermione
hissed as she tried to help Ron restrain their friend, "The
professors are all staring at us."</p>
      <p>"I
don't care," Neville snapped. "Ken Stebbins has been talking to
that gossip-mongering mum of his, and now Luna hates me!"</p>
      <p>Harry
leaned forward, lowering his voice. "Don't be a prat. She doesn't
hate you, and revenge is a dish best served cold."</p>
      <p>Neville
frowned uncertainly as he stopped struggling. Harry gave him what he
hoped was an evil grin. Neville and Ron both suddenly leaned back, so
he wasn't sure if he'd succeeded or not... Ginny's elbow got
his attention and he leaned back himself as Professor McGonagall
arrived.</p>
      <p>"What
seems to be the problem here?" she asked in a sharp voice, no doubt
irritated at having her meal interrupted.</p>
      <p>"Nothing,
Professor," Harry answered quickly.</p>
      <p>McGonagall
merely raised an eyebrow and turned toward Hermione.</p>
      <p>"Ah,
we were just, ah, surprised by the Howler," Hermione explained.</p>
      <p>"Ah
yes, the Howler," she said. "While it wasn't allowed to
finish," she observed, glancing down at Harry, "I do believe I
recognized Augusta Longbottom's voice. Mr. Longbottom, would you
care to explain what you have done to cause your grandmother this
degree of distress?"</p>
      <p>Neville
looked up, his eyes still angry, and Harry gripped the edge of the
table. "I believe I offended her bigoted, pure-blood sensibilities,
professor," he replied evenly.</p>
      <p>"I
see," Professor McGonagall said, her eyes boring into Neville, who
was either oblivious or too angry to care. Either option scared Harry
just a little bit. Completely unnatural, that's what it was.</p>
      <p>"I
think everything is all right now, Professor," Harry said, hoping
to distract her before Neville said anything else.</p>
      <p>"Is
that so, Mr. Potter?" she asked, turning toward Harry.</p>
      <p>Harry
tried to give her his most innocent smile as he assured her that
everything was under control... really, he did. His smile was
absolutely nothing like the evil grin he'd given Neville earlier.</p>
      <p>So
why did Professor McGonagall suddenly go pale and step back like
she'd seen a ghost?</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>After
the evening meal, Harry, Ron, and Neville took a detour on their way
back to the Gryffindor common room. Luna had stayed in her dormitory
the entire day, claiming she wasn't feeling well, and Neville moped
around with a face like a dropped pie.</p>
      <p>Harry
didn't know if a little creative revenge on this Stebbins bloke
would make Neville feel better, but he was willing to give it a shot.
He knew Ginny and Hermione were working on Luna, and he was confident
that they would succeed. He knew from personal experience how good
Ginny was at cheering someone up.</p>
      <p>As
soon as they were out of sight, Harry walked them through an
incantation he'd picked up from a British Auror, though the man
claimed the idea for the spell originally came from a bloke from
Wisconsin, of all places.</p>
      <p>"<em>Arachnos
podares,"</em>
he whispered, tapping each of his feet with his wand. Ron and Neville
copied him, though Ron looked a little uncomfortable. Harry lifted
his leg and set his foot against the wall of the alcove they stood
in. Taking a deep breath, he pulled his other foot up and soon was
walking right up the wall.</p>
      <p>The
other two followed, and soon they were all walking across the wall
and up to the ceiling. Harry was reminded, to his annoyance, that
school robes were not exactly made to be worn when standing upside
down. It took several sticking charms applied to the hem of his robes
to get them attached to his trousers and not hang down in front of
his face. Getting Neville and Ron similarly kitted out consumed
precious minutes.</p>
      <p>Finally,
they made it to the corridor outside the Hufflepuff common room, with
five minutes to spare before curfew. According to Fred and George,
Kenneth Stebbins had a girl in Ravenclaw that he spent an inordinate
amount of time studying with. Or rather, studying. According to
gossip amongst the upper forms, he hadn't talked her into
inspecting any broom cupboards as of yet, but he tended to make it
back to his own common room only at the last minute each night.</p>
      <p>The
corridor with the entrance to the 'Puffs common room was well lit,
but the corridor that it connected onto had a higher ceiling with
arches that seemed to collect the shadows. It was in one of these
that the three Gryffindors lurked, waiting for their target.</p>
      <p>Sure
enough, with a minute to spare, the blond-haired sixth-year student
came racing around the corner. Fortunately, they'd already worked
out their plans ahead of time.</p>
      <p>Neville
led off with a low-powered jinx that made the floor momentarily
slippery under the Hufflepuff's feet. Stebbins went arse over
teakettle as he turned the corner, knocking the wind out of himself
which preventing him from noticing the other two spells. Ron's
spell was a Flatulence Curse he'd picked up from Fred that would
make Stebbins <em>extremely</em>
unpopular with his dorm-mates tonight. Harry's was a variation on
the Babel Curse that Hermione had suggested after she realized she
wasn't going to talk them out of pranking the older student. At
random times throughout the next twenty-four hours, Kenneth Stebbins
would speak words that sounded perfectly normal to himself, but would
sound like complete gibberish to anyone else.</p>
      <p>Stebbins
picked himself up with a groan, muttering something that made no
sense whatsoever. He paused while standing up, only to pass gas that
was shockingly loud in the silent corridor. Then he collected himself
and made his way to his common room before he was caught out of
bounds.</p>
      <p>Harry
and his friends carefully picked their way across the corridor
ceilings, getting far away from the Hufflepuff corridor before
descending to the floor again.</p>
      <p>It
wasn't long after curfew, and the prefects were probably still
getting ready to do their rounds, but Harry didn't want to take any
chances on running into Filch. He pulled his father's Invisibility
Cloak out of his robes and spread it over the three of them. They
were growing large enough now that with three of them under it, the
hem of the Cloak didn't meet the ground evenly anymore. Harry bit
his lip as he realized this and silently blessed the shadowy corridor
they traversed back to the Gryffindor tower.</p>
      <p>They
did have one close call, when Cedric Diggory passed them on one of
the moving stairs. All three of the Gryffindors simultaneously
crouched as they edged together toward the railing. The hem of the
Cloak touched the marble just as the stairway's motion rotated them
through a brighter area under a floating chandelier. Harry lost track
of how long he'd held his breath, but dark spots were swarming in
front of his eyes by the time Cedric rounded the corner.</p>
      <p>Melissa
Bulstrode was just leaving the corridor in front of the Fat Lady's
portrait when they arrived. Fortunately, she was heading toward the
opposite end of the corridor, so they were spared another close call.</p>
      <p>The
Fat Lady was already settling down for the night, sipping what
appeared to be a rather large glass of port. So when Harry whispered
the password, she opened up without even looking up. Harry whipped
off the Cloak as they passed through the opening, quickly stuffing it
under his robes again.</p>
      <p>Ginny
immediately jumped up from one of the chairs near the door. "Move
quickly," she said in a low voice, "Percy is out looking for you.
The twins ran interference for a while, but I think he saw through
them."</p>
      <p>Harry,
Ron, and Neville immediately made for their dormitory, ignoring the
knowing smiles from the older members of the Quidditch team. Harry
figured they were used to watching Percy chase Fred and George. Ginny
followed them up the stairs as well.</p>
      <p>Harry
threw open the door, startling a small yelp from Hermione as she and
Luna jumped up from sitting on Harry's bed. Dean and Seamus, who
were sitting on the floor playing Gobstones, both began to snicker.</p>
      <p>"Did
you find him? Were you caught? Did those charms work? What took you
so long?" Hermione asked without pausing for breath.</p>
      <p>Ginny,
who was bringing up the rear, managed to get the door shut before she
began giggling. Ron bit his lip, while Neville cocked his head,
trying to meet Luna's eyes.</p>
      <p>Harry
sighed. "Yes. No. Yes. We were being careful not to get caught.
Were there any other questions?" he asked sardonically.</p>
      <p>Hermione
huffed in exasperation, but everyone's attention was diverted when
Luna looked up and spoke. "Neville, I'm sorry I embarrassed you
today."</p>
      <p>Neville
blinked and took a second to digest this. "Luna, you didn't
embarrass me at all. My Gran embarrassed both of us. I want to
formally apologize to you on behalf of my family," he continued in
a formal tone. "Her remarks and actions this past summer have been
wholly inappropriate and constitute conduct unbefitting a
Longbottom."</p>
      <p>Harry
wasn't sure what that meant, but Neville's words had the sound of
some sort of legal formula. From the way Ron's eyes were bulging,
it seemed to be pretty serious, too.</p>
      <p>Neville
turned to Hermione and asked a question that captured everyone's
attention. "Do you know the incantation to create a Howler?" he
asked.</p>
      <p>OoOoO</p>
      <p>Marguerite
Stebbins looked around in shock, her ears ringing quite loudly.</p>
      <p>One
moment they'd been holding a meeting of the East Lancashire
Horticultural Society, the next moment a white snowy owl flew in the
window and dropped a smoking red envelope in Augusta Longbottom's
tea!</p>
      <p>Scowling,
the old woman ripped open the envelope before it could explode,
ignoring the droppings the ill-mannered bird deposited on the
antimacassar.</p>
      <p>While
they were not exactly friends, Marguerite had known Augusta for
years. They'd formed an alliance of sorts against members of the
society that wanted to 'modernize' their standards - standards
that had proved more than sufficient for generations of their
ancestors. In any event, she couldn't conceive of <em>anyone</em>
who had the audacity to send Madam Longbottom a Howler - it was
inconceivable!</p>
      <p>So
if she was reeling before the Howler began, she was in shock when she
heard the voice of Augusta's grandson, Neville, taking her to task!</p>
      <p>"Gran,
I've always had a lot of respect for you, and what you're willing
to do for the family, but this time you've gone too far," it
began. The words were fairly mild, as far as Howlers go, but they
were pronounced at an ear-splitting volume. Members of the society,
flinched back, spilling their tea, upsetting chairs, and generally
adding to the bedlam.</p>
      <p>"Your
actions yesterday hurt me, and, worse, they hurt my friends. And
that, I will not allow. Now, we can continue exchanging Howlers,
though I can guarantee that none you send me will ever be heard, or
we can meet this weekend. Hogwarts is having a Hogsmeade weekend and
I will meet you at the Three Broomsticks at noon if you wish to
continue this ridiculous vendetta. Reply by a regular letter if that
time is unsuitable," and with that, the Howler exploded into a fine
spray of ash. The polite request at the end, added in something much
closer to Neville's normal tone of voice, was almost too much for
Marguerite's composure. Lips twitching slightly, she peered at
Augusta, who appeared unruffled, except for two faint spots of colour
that burned just below her cheekbones.</p>
      <p>Marguerite
decided she'd better owl Kenneth once she was home. It would be
best if her son was careful that no one knew he'd told her of
Neville's continued association with some of the lower sorts in his
house. It just wouldn't do to be involved with this particular
family squabble.</p>
